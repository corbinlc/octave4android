   This is a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Octave users.

   We are always looking for new questions (_with_ answers), better
answers, or both. Please send suggestions to `http://bugs.octave.org'.
If you have general questions about Octave, or need help for something
that is not covered by the Octave manual or the FAQ, please use the
<help@octave.org> mailing list.

   This FAQ is intended to supplement, not replace, the Octave manual.
Before posting a question to the <help@octave.org> mailing list, you
should first check to see if the topic is covered in the manual.

1 What is Octave?
*****************

Octave is a high-level interactive language, primarily intended for
numerical computations that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.(1)

   Octave can do arithmetic for real, complex or integer-valued scalars
and matrices, solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate
functions over finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of
ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations.

   Octave uses the GNU readline library to handle reading and editing
input.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to the cursor
movement commands used by GNU Emacs, and a vi-style line editing
interface is also available.  At the end of each session, the command
history is saved, so that commands entered during previous sessions are
not lost.

   The Octave distribution includes a 650+ page Texinfo manual. Access
to the complete text of the manual is available via the `doc' command
at the Octave prompt.

1.1 Who develops Octave?
========================

Discussions about writing the software that would eventually become
Octave started in about 1988 with James B. Rawlings and John W. Eaton at
the University of Texas. John W. Eaton was the original author of
Octave, starting full-time development in February 1992. He is still the
primary maintainer. The community of users/developers has in addition
contributed some code and fuels the discussion on the mailing lists
<help@octave.org> (user forum), <maintainers@octave.org> (development
issues), and <octave-dev@lists.sourceforge.net> (all things related to
the Octave Forge repository of user-contributed functions).


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Why GNU Octave?,  Next: What version should I use?,  Prev: Who develops Octave?,  Up: What is Octave?

1.2 Why GNU Octave?
===================

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.

   GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced
guh-noo, approximately like canoe.

   The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is the principal organizational
sponsor of the GNU Project.

   Octave became GNU Octave in 1997 (beginning with version 2.0.6).
This meant agreeing to consider Octave a part of the GNU Project and
support the efforts of the FSF.  However, Octave is not and has never
been developed by the FSF.

   For more information about the GNU project, see `www.gnu.org'.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: What version should I use?,  Next: On what platforms does Octave run?,  Prev: Why GNU Octave?,  Up: What is Octave?

1.3 What version should I use?
==============================

In general, you will find the latest version on
`http://www.octave.org/download.html'. It is recommended to use the
"stable" version of octave for general use, and the "development"
version if you want the latest features.

   A list of user-visible changes since the last release is available in
the file `NEWS'.  The file `ChangeLog' in the source distribution
contains a more detailed record of changes made since the last release.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: On what platforms does Octave run?,  Prev: What version should I use?,  Up: What is Octave?

1.4 On what platforms does Octave run?
======================================

Octave runs on various Unices--at least Linux and Solaris, Mac OS X,
Windows and anything you can compile it on.  Binary distributions exist
at least for Debian, Suse, Fedora and RedHat Linuxes (Intel and AMD
CPUs, at least), for Mac OS X and Windows' 98, 2000, XP, Vista, and 7.

   Two and three dimensional plotting is fully supported using gnuplot
and an experimental OpenGL backend.

   The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
like LAPACK, LINPACK, ODEPACK, the BLAS, etc., packaged in a library of
C++ classes.  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled with
the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
functions.  If that's not possible, you can still compile Octave if you
have the free Fortran to C translator f2c.

   Octave is also free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3, as
published by the Free Software Foundation, or at your option any later
version.

2 Licensing Issues
******************

* Menu:

* If I write code using Octave do I have to release it under the GPL?: GPL
* Since the MEX interface allows plugins to be distributed under terms that are incompatible with the GPL, does this mean that you are encouraging people to to write non-free software for Octave?: Licensing MEX Files

File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: GPL,  Next: Licensing MEX Files,  Up: Licensing Issues

2.1 If I write code using Octave do I have to release it under the GPL?
=======================================================================

The answer depends on precisely how the code is written and how it
works.

   Code written entirely in the scripting language of Octave
(interpreted code in .m files) may be released under the terms of
whatever license you choose.

   Code written using Octave's native plug-in interface (also known as
a .oct file) necessarily links with Octave internals and is considered
a derivative work of Octave and therefore must be released under terms
that are compatible with the GPL.

   Code written using Octave's implementation of the MATLAB MEX
interface may be released under the terms of whatever license you
choose, provided that the following conditions are met:

  1. The plugin should not use any bindings that are specific to
     Octave.  In other words, the MEX file must use the MEX interface
     only, and not also call on other Octave internals.  It should be
     possible in principle to use the MEX file with other programs that
     implement the MEX interface (e.g., MATLAB).

  2. The MEX file should not be distributed together with Octave in
     such a way that they effectively create a single work.  For
     example, you should not distribute the MEX file and Octave
     together in a single package such that Octave automatically loads
     and runs the MEX file when it starts up.  There are other possible
     ways that you might effectively create a single work; this is just
     one example.

   A program that embeds the Octave interpreter (e.g., by calling the
"octave_main" function), or that calls functions from Octave's
libraries (e.g., liboctinterp, liboctave, or libcruft) is considered a
derivative work of Octave and therefore must be released under terms
that are compatible with the GPL.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Licensing MEX Files,  Next: Requesting License Changes,  Prev: GPL,  Up: Licensing Issues

2.2 Since the MEX interface allows plugins to be distributed under terms that are incompatible with the GPL, does this mean that you are encouraging people to to write non-free software for Octave?
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

No.  The original reason for implementing the MEX interface for Octave
was to allow Octave to run free software that uses MEX files (the
particular goal was to run SundialsTB in Octave).  The intent was to
liberate that software from MATLAB and increase the amount of free
software available to Octave users, not to enable people to write
proprietary code for Octave.  For the good of the community, we strongly
encourage users of Octave to release the code they write for Octave
under terms that are compatible with the GPL.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Requesting License Changes,  Prev: Licensing MEX Files,  Up: Licensing Issues

2.3 I wrote a program that links with Octave libraries and I don't want to release it under the terms of the GPL.  Will you change the license of the Octave libraries for me?
==============================================================================================================================================================================

No.  Instead of asking us to change the licensing terms for Octave, we
recommend that you release your program under terms that are compatible
with the GPL so that the free software community can benefit from your
work the same as you have benefited from the work of all the people who
have contributed to Octave.

3 How can I cite Octave?
************************

Pointing to `http://www.octave.org' is good, because that gives people
a direct way to find out more.  If citation of a URL is not allowed by
a publisher, or if you also want to point to a traditional reference,
then you can cite the Octave manual:

     @BOOK{eaton:2008,
       author =     "John W. Eaton and David Bateman and Søren Hauberg",
       title =      "GNU Octave Manual Version 3",
       publisher =  "Network Theory Limited",
       year =       "2008",
       isbn =       "0-9546120-6-X"
     }

4 What's new in version series 3.4.N and 3.5.N of Octave
********************************************************

The 3.4.N series has enough new features to justify a minor version
number change. The full details are in the `NEWS' file, but in brief
3.4.N series brings:

   * ARPACK now distributed with Octave

   * Indexing optimisations

   * FTP object using `libcurl'

   * Better consistency with ismatrix, issquare, and issymetric

   * Function handles aware of overloaded functions

   * More efficient matrix division by making a single LAPACK call

   * Other optimisations in matrix operations

   * `bsxfun' optimised for basic arithmetic functions

   * MATLAB-style ignoring of output arguments using `~'

   * Many optimisations of the `accumarray' function

   * Sparse matrix indexing has been rewritten for speed

   * Configuration pseudo-variables like `page_screen_output' accept a
     "local" option argument to limit their scope to function scope

   * The `pkg' command now accepts a `-forge' option to pull packages
     directly from Octave-forge

   * Several `dlmread' improvements

   * Octave now uses gnulib for better cross-platform compatibility


   Here are some features that have been around since 3.2.N

   * integer types

   * fixed point arithmetic

   * sparse matrices

   * Linear programming code based on GLPK

   * 64-bit compilation support

   * gzipped files and stream and consequently support of MATLAB v7
     files

   * better support for both msvc and mingw

   * a fully compatible MEX interface

   * many many other minor features and compatibility changes

   * OpenGL graphics toolkit

     An experimental OpenGL graphics toolkit to replace gnuplot.

   * Object Orient Programming

   * Block comments

   * imwrite and imread

     The functions are based on the GraphicsMagick library.

   * Lazy transpose

     Special treatment in the parser of things like "a' * b", where the
     transpose is never explicitly formed but a flag is rather passed
     to the underlying LAPACK code.

   * Single precision type

   * Improved array indexing The underlying code used for indexing of
     arrays has been completely rewritten and so the indexing of arrays
     is now significantly faster.


   Here are some older features that have been around since 2.1.N:

   * NDarrays

   * cells


   The 3.5.N series is the current development release and will become a
3.6.N release in the future. This series brings the following new
features:

   * Perl-compatible regular expressions are now part of Octave

File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Functions defined on the command-line,  Next: Comments with #,  Up: Octave Features

5.1 Functions defined on the command-line
=========================================

Functions can be defined by entering code on the command line, a feature
not supported by MATLAB. For example, you may type:

     octave:1> function s = hello_string (to_who)
     > ## Say hello
     > if nargin<1, to_who = "World"; end
     > s = ["Hello ",\
     >      to_who];
     > endfunction
     octave:2> hello_string ("Moon")
     ans = Hello Moon


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Comments with #,  Next: Strings delimited by double quotes ",  Prev: Functions defined on the command-line,  Up: Octave Features

5.2 Comments with #
===================

The pound character, `#', may be used to start comments, in addition to
`%'. See the previous example. The major advantage of this is that as
`#' is also a comment character for unix script files, any file that
starts with a string like `#! /usr/bin/octave -q' will be treated as an
octave script and be executed by octave.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Strings delimited by double quotes ",  Next: Line continuation by backslash,  Prev: Comments with #,  Up: Octave Features

5.3 Strings delimited by double quotes "
========================================

The double quote, `"', may be used to delimit strings, in addition to
the single quote `''. See the previous example. Also, double-quoted
strings include backslash interpretation (like C++, C, and Perl) while
single quoted are uninterpreted (like MATLAB and Perl).


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Line continuation by backslash,  Next: Informative block closing,  Prev: Strings delimited by double quotes ",  Up: Octave Features

5.4 Line continuation by backslash
==================================

Lines can be continued with a backslash, `\', in addition to three
points `...'.  See the previous example.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Informative block closing,  Next: Coherent syntax,  Prev: Line continuation by backslash,  Up: Octave Features

5.5 Informative block closing
=============================

You may close `function', `for', `while', `if', ... blocks with
`endfunction', `endfor', `endwhile', ... keywords in addition to using
`end'.  As with MATLAB, the `end' (or `endfunction') keyword that marks
the end of a function defined in a `.m' file is optional.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Coherent syntax,  Next: Exclamation mark as not operator,  Prev: Informative block closing,  Up: Octave Features

5.6 Coherent syntax
===================

Indexing other things than variables is possible, as in:
     octave:1> [3 1 4 1 5 9](3)
     ans = 4
     octave:2> cos([0 pi pi/4 7])(3)
     ans = 0.70711


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Exclamation mark as not operator,  Next: Increment and decrement operators,  Prev: Coherent syntax,  Up: Octave Features

5.7 Exclamation mark as not operator
====================================

The exclamation mark `!' (aka "Bang!") is a negation operator, just
like the tilde `~':

     octave:1> if ! strcmp (program_name, "octave"),
     >   "It's an error"
     > else
     >   "It works!"
     > end
     ans = It works!

Note however that MATLAB uses the `!' operator for shell escapes, for
which Octave requires using the `system' command.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Increment and decrement operators,  Next: Unwind-protect,  Prev: Exclamation mark as not operator,  Up: Octave Features

5.8 Increment and decrement operators
=====================================

If you like the `++', `+=' etc operators, rejoice!  Octave includes the
C-like increment and decrement operators `++' and `--' in both their
prefix and postfix forms, in addition to `+=', `-=', `*=', `/=', `^=',
`.*=', `./=', and `.^='.

   For example, to pre-increment the variable X, you would write `++X'.
This would add one to X and then return the new value of X as the
result of the expression.  It is exactly the same as the expression `X
= X + 1'.

   To post-increment a variable X, you would write `x++'.  This adds
one to the variable X, but returns the value that X had prior to
incrementing it.  For example, if X is equal to 2, the result of the
expression `x++' is 2, and the new value of X is 3.

   For matrix and vector arguments, the increment and decrement
operators work on each element of the operand.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Unwind-protect,  Next: Built-in ODE and DAE solvers,  Prev: Increment and decrement operators,  Up: Octave Features

5.9 Unwind-protect
==================

Octave supports a limited form of exception handling modeled after the
unwind-protect form of Lisp.  The general form of an `unwind_protect'
block looks like this:

     unwind_protect
       BODY
     unwind_protect_cleanup
       CLEANUP
     end_unwind_protect

Where BODY and CLEANUP are both optional and may contain any Octave
expressions or commands.  The statements in CLEANUP are guaranteed to
be executed regardless of how control exits BODY.

   The `unwind_protect' statement is often used to reliably restore the
values of global variables that need to be temporarily changed.

   MATLAB can be made to do something similar with their `OnCleanUp'
function that was introduced in 2008a. Octave also has `onCleanup'
since version 3.4.0.


File: OctaveFAQ.info,  Node: Built-in ODE and DAE solvers,  Prev: Unwind-protect,  Up: Octave Features

5.10 Built-in ODE and DAE solvers
=================================

Octave includes LSODE and DASSL for solving systems of stiff ordinary
differential and differential-algebraic equations.  These functions are
built in to the interpreter.

8 Installation Issues and Problems
**********************************

Octave 3.4 require approximately 1.3 GB of disk storage to unpack and
compile from source (considerably less if you don't compile with
debugging symbols). Once installed, Octave requires approximately 355 MB
of disk space (again, considerably less if you don't compile with
debugging symbols, approximately 50 MB).

8.1 What else do I need?
========================

To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
will also need GCC 4.3  or later, although GCC 4.4 or later is
recommended.

   *You must have GNU Make to compile octave*.  Octave's Makefiles use
features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of make.
GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.

8.2 Can I compile Octave with another C++ compiler?
===================================================

Yes, but development is done primarily with GCC, so you may hit some
incompatibilities. Octave is intended to be portable to any standard
conforming compiler. If you have difficulties that you think are bugs,
please report them to the `http://bugs.octave.org' bug tracker, or ask
for help on the <help@octave.org> mailing list.

9 Common problems
*****************

This list is probably far too short.  Feel free to suggest additional
questions (preferably with answers!)

   * Octave takes a long time to find symbols.

     Octave uses the `genpath' function to recursively add directories
     to the list of directories searched for function files.  Check the
     list of directories with the `path' command. If the path list is
     very long check your use of the `genpath' function.

   * When plotting Octave occasionally gives me errors like `gnuplot> 9
     0.735604 line 26317: invalid command'.

     There is a known bug in gnuplot 4.2 that can cause an off by one
     error while piping data to gnuplot. It has been fixed in gnuplot
     4.4.

     If you have obtained your copy of Octave from a distribution
     please file a bug report requesting that the fix reported in the
     above bug report be included.

   * I cannot install a package. Octave complains about a missing
     `mkoctfile'.

     Most distributions split Octave into several packages. The script
     `mkoctfile' is then part of a separate package:
        - Debian/Ubuntu

          `aptitude install octave-headers'

        - Fedora

          `yum install octave-devel'

10.2 How does Octave solve linear systems?
==========================================

In addition to consulting Octave's source for the precise details, the
Octave manual contains a complete high-level description of the
algorithm that Octave uses to decide how to solve a particular linear
system, e.g. how the backslash operator `A\x' will be interpreted.
Sections "Techniques Used for Linear Algebra" and "Linear Algebra on
Sparse Matrices" from the manual describe this procedure.

     I wrote some code for MATLAB, and I want to get it running under
     Octave.  Is there anything I should watch out for?

or alternatively

     I wrote some code in Octave, and want to share it with MATLAB
     users.  Is there anything I should watch out for?

which is not quite the same thing.  There are still a number of
differences between Octave and MATLAB, however in general differences
between the two are considered as bugs.  Octave might consider that the
bug is in MATLAB and do nothing about it, but generally functionality
is almost identical.  If you find a difference between Octave behavior
and MATLAB, then you should send a description of this difference (with
code illustrating the difference, if possible) to
`http://bugs.octave.org'.

   Furthermore, Octave adds a few syntactical extensions to MATLAB that
might cause some issues when exchanging files between MATLAB and Octave
users. As both Octave and MATLAB are under constant development the
information in this section is subject to change at anytime.

   You should also look at the page
`http://octave.sourceforge.net/packages.html' and
`http://octave.sourceforge.net/doc/' that has a function reference that
is up to date. You can use this function reference to see the number of
octave function that are available and their MATLAB compatibility.

   The major differences between Octave 3.4.N and  MATLAB R2010b are:

   * Nested Functions

     Octave has limited support for nested functions. That is

          function y = foo (x)
            y = bar(x)
            function y = bar (x)
              y = ...;
            end
          end

     is equivalent to

          function y = foo (x)
             y = bar(x)
          end
          function y = bar (x)
             y = ...;
          end

     The main difference with MATLAB is a matter of scope. While nested
     functions have access to the parent function's scope in MATLAB, no
     such thing is available in Octave, due to how Octave essentially
     "un-nests" nested functions.

     The authors of Octave consider the nested function scoping rules of
     MATLAB to be more problems than they are worth as they introduce
     difficult to find bugs as inadvertently modifying a variable in a
     nested function that is also used in the parent is particularly
     easy.

   * Differences in core syntax There a few core MATLAB syntaxes that
     are not accepted by Octave, these being

        * Some limitations on the use of function handles. The major
          difference is related to nested function scoping rules (as
          above) and their use with function handles.

        * Some limitations of variable argument lists on the LHS of an
          expression, though the most common types are accepted.

        * MATLAB classdef object oriented programming is not yet
          supported, though work is underway and when development more
          on to Octave 3.5 this will be included in the development
          tree.

   * Differences in core functions A large number of the MATLAB core
     functions (ie those that are in the core and not a toolbox) are
     implemented, and certainly all of the commonly used ones. There
     are a few functions that aren't implemented, usually to do with
     specific missing Octave functionality (GUI, DLL, Java, ActiveX,
     DDE, web, and serial functions). Some of the core functions have
     limitations that aren't in the MATLAB version. For example the
     `sprandn' function can not force a particular condition number for
     the matrix like MATLAB can.

   * Just-In-Time compiler MATLAB includes a "Just-In-Time" compiler.
     This compiler allows the acceleration of for-loops in MATLAB to
     almost native performance with certain restrictions. The JIT must
     know the return type of all functions called in the loops and so
     you can't include user functions in the loop of JIT optimized
     loops. Octave doesn't have a JIT and so to some might seem slower
     than MATLAB. For this reason you must vectorize your code as much
     as possible. The MathWorks themselves have a good document
     discussing vectorization at
     `http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1109.html'.

   * Compiler On a related point, there is no Octave compiler, and so
     you can't convert your Octave code into a binary for additional
     speed or distribution. There have been several aborted attempts at
     creating an Octave compiler. Should the JIT compiler above ever be
     implemented, an Octave compiler should be more feasible.

   * Graphic Handles Up to Octave 2.9.9 there was no support for
     graphic handles in Octave itself. In the 3.2.N versions of Octave
     and beyond the support for graphics handles is converging towards
     full compatibility. The `patch' function is currently limited to
     2-D patches, due to an underlying limitation in gnuplot, but the
     experimental OpenGL backend is starting to see an implementation
     of 3-D patches.

   * GUI There are no MATLAB compatible GUI functions. There are a
     number of bindings from Octave to Tcl/Tk, VTK and Zenity included
     in the Octave Forge project (`http://octave.sourceforge.net') for
     example that can be used for a GUI, but these are not MATLAB
     compatible. Work on a MATLAB compatible GUI is in an alpha stage
     in the JHandles package
     (`http://octave.sourceforge.net/jhandles/index.html'). This might
     be an issue if you intend to exchange Octave code with MATLAB
     users.

   * Simulink Octave itself includes no Simulink support. Typically the
     simulink models lag research and are less flexible, so shouldn't
     really be used in a research environment.  However, some MATLAB
     users that try to use Octave complain about this lack.  There is a
     similar package to simulink for the Octave and R projects
     available at `http://www.scicraft.org/'

   * Mex-Files Octave includes an API to the MATLAB MEX interface.
     However, as MEX is an API to the internals of MATLAB and the
     internals of Octave differ from MATLAB, there is necessarily a
     manipulation of the data to convert from a MEX interface to the
     Octave equivalent. This is notable for all complex matrices, where
     MATLAB stores complex arrays as real and imaginary parts, whereas
     Octave respects the C99/C++ standards of co-locating the real/imag
     parts in memory. Also due to the way MATLAB allows access to the
     arrays passed through a pointer, the MEX interface might require
     copies of arrays (even non complex ones).

   * Block comments Block comments denoted by "%{" and "%}" markers are
     supported by Octave with some limitations. The major limitation is
     that block comments are not supported within [] or {}.

   * Mat-File format There are some differences in the mat v5 file
     format accepted by Octave.  MATLAB recently introduced the "-V7.3"
     save option which is an HDF5 format which is particularly useful
     for 64-bit platforms where the standard MATLAB format can not
     correctly save variables. Octave accepts HDF5 files, but is not
     yet compatible with the "-v7.3" versions produced by MATLAB.

     Although Octave can load inline function handles saved by MATLAB,
     it can not yet save them.

     Finally, Some multi-byte Unicode characters aren't yet treated in
     mat-files.

   * Profiler Octave doesn't have a profiler. Though there is a patch
     for a flat profiler, that might become a real profiler sometime in
     the future. See the thread

     `http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Octave-profiler-td1641945.html#a1641947'

     for more details.

   * Toolboxes Octave is a community project and so the toolboxes that
     exist are donated by those interested in them through the Octave
     Forge website (`http://octave.sourceforge.net'). These might be
     lacking in certain functionality relative to the MATLAB toolboxes,
     and might not exactly duplicate the MATLAB functionality or
     interface.

   * Short-circuit & and | operators The `&' and `|' operators in
     MATLAB short-circuit when included in an if statement and not
     otherwise.  In Octave only the `&&' and `||' short circuit.  Note
     that this means that

            if (a | b)
              ...
            end

     and

            t = a | b;
            if t
              ...
            end

     are different in MATLAB. This is really a MATLAB bug, but there is
     too much code out there that relies on this behaviour to change
     it. Prefer the || and && operators in if statements if possible.
     If you need to use code written for MATLAB that depends on this
     buggy behaviour, you can enable it since Octave 3.4.0 with the
     following command:

            do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation(1)

     Note that the difference with MATLAB is also significant when
     either argument is a function with side effects or if the first
     argument is a scalar and the second argument is an empty matrix.
     For example, note the difference between

            t = 1 | [];          ## results in [], so...
            if (t) 1, end        ## in if ([]), this is false.

     and

            if (1 | []) 1, end   ## short circuits so condition is true.

     Another case that is documented in the MATLAB manuals is that

            t = [1, 1] | [1, 2, 3];          ## error
            if ([1, 1] | [1, 2, 3]) 1, end   ## OK

     Also MATLAB requires the operands of && and || to be scalar values
     but Octave does not (it just applies the rule that for an operand
     to be considered true, every element of the object must be nonzero
     or logically true).

     Finally, note the inconsistence of thinking of the condition of an
     if statement as being equivalent to `all(X(:))' when X is a
     matrix.  This is true for all cases EXCEPT empty matrices:

            if ([0, 1]) == if (all ([0, 1]))   ==>  i.e., condition is false.
            if ([1, 1]) == if (all ([1, 1]))   ==>  i.e., condition is true.

     However,

            if ([]) != if (all ([]))

     because `samp ([]) == 1' because, despite the name, it is really
     returning true if none of the elements of the matrix are zero, and
     since there are no elements, well, none of them are zero. This is
     an example of vacuous truth. But, somewhere along the line,
     someone decided that if `([])' should be false. Mathworks probably
     thought it just looks wrong to have `[]' be true in this context
     even if you can use logical gymnastics to convince yourself that
     "all" the elements of a matrix that doesn't actually have any
     elements are nonzero. Octave however duplicates this behavior for
     if statements containing empty matrices.

   * Solvers for singular, under- and over-determined matrices

     MATLAB's solvers as used by the operators mldivide (\) and mrdivide
     (/), use a different approach than Octave's in the case of
     singular, under-, or over-determined matrices. In the case of a
     singular matrix, MATLAB returns the result given by the LU
     decomposition, even though the underlying solver has flagged the
     result as erroneous. Octave has made the choice of falling back to
     a minimum norm solution of matrices that have been flagged as
     singular which arguably is a better result for these cases.

     In the case of under- or over-determined matrices, Octave
     continues to use a minimum norm solution, whereas MATLAB uses an
     approach that is equivalent to

          function x = mldivide (A, b)
            [Q, R, E] = qr(A);
            x = [A \ b, E(:, 1:m) * (R(:, 1:m) \ (Q' * b))]
          end

     While this approach is certainly faster and uses less memory than
     Octave's minimum norm approach, this approach seems to be inferior
     in other ways.

     A numerical question arises: how big can the null space component
     become, relative to the minimum-norm solution? Can it be nicely
     bounded, or can it be arbitrarily big? Consider this example:

          m = 10;
          n = 10000;
          A = ones(m, n) + 1e-6 * randn(m,n);
          b = ones(m, 1) + 1e-6 * randn(m,1);
          norm(A \ b)

     while Octave's minimum-norm values are around 3e-2, MATLAB's
     results are 50-times larger. For another issue, try this code:

          m = 5;
          n = 100;
          j = floor(m * rand(1, n)) + 1;
          b = ones(m, 1);
          A = zeros(m, n);
          A(sub2ind(size(A),j,1:n)) = 1;
          x = A \ b;
          [dummy,p] = sort(rand(1,n));
          y = A(:,p)\b;
          norm(x(p)-y)

     It shows that unlike in Octave, mldivide in MATLAB is not invariant
     with respect to column permutations. If there are multiple columns
     of the same norm, permuting columns of the matrix gets you
     different result than permuting the solution vector. This will
     surprise many users.

     Since the mldivide (\) and mrdivide (/) operators are often part
     of a more complex expression, where there is no room to react to
     warnings or flags, it should prefer intelligence (robustness) to
     speed, and so the Octave developers are firmly of the opinion that
     Octave's approach for singular, under- and over-determined
     matrices is a better choice that MATLAB's

   * Octave extensions The extensions in Octave over MATLAB syntax are
     very useful, but might cause issues when sharing with MATLAB users.
     A list of the major extensions that should be avoided to be
     compatible with MATLAB are

        * Comments in octave can be marked with `#'. This allows POSIX
          systems to have the first line as `#! octave -q' and mark the
          script itself executable. MATLAB doesn't have this feature
          due to the absence of comments starting with `#'".

        * Code blocks like `if', `for', `while', etc can be terminated
          with block specific terminations like `endif'.  MATLAB
          doesn't have this and all blocks must be terminated with
          `end'.

        * Octave has a lisp like `unwind_protect' block that allows
          blocks of code that terminate in an error to ensure that the
          variables that are touched are restored. You can do something
          similar with `try'/`catch' combined with `rethrow (lasterror
          ())' in MATLAB, however rethrow and lasterror are only
          available in Octave 2.9.10 and later. MATLAB 2008a also
          introduced `OnCleanUp' that is similar to `unwind_protect',
          except that the object created by this function has to be
          explicitly cleared in order for the cleanup code to run.

          Note that using `try'/`catch' combined with `rethrow
          (lasterror ())' can not guarantee that global variables will
          be correctly reset, as it won't catch user interrupts with
          Ctrl-C. For example

                 global a
                 a = 1;
                 try
                   _a = a;
                   a = 2
                   while true
                   end
                 catch
                   fprintf ('caught interrupt\n');
                   a = _a;
                   rethrow (lasterror());
                 end

          compared to

                 global a
                 a = 1;
                 unwind_protect
                   _a = a;
                   a = 2
                   while true
                   end
                 unwind_protect_cleanup
                   fprintf ('caught interrupt\n');
                   a = _a;
                 end

          Typing Ctrl-C in the first case returns the user directly to
          the prompt, and the variable "a" is not reset to the saved
          value. In the second case the variable "a" is reset
          correctly.  Therefore MATLAB gives no safe way of temporarily
          changing global variables.

        * Indexing can be applied to all objects in Octave and not just
          variable. Therefore `sin(x)(1:10);' for example is perfectly
          valid in Octave but not MATLAB. To do the same in MATLAB you
          must do `y = sin(x); y = y([1:10]);'

        * Octave has the operators "++", "-", "-=", "+=", "*=", etc.  As
          MATLAB doesn't, if you are sharing code these should be
          avoided.

        * Character strings in Octave can be denoted with double or
          single quotes. There is a subtle difference between the two
          in that escaped characters like `\n' (newline), `\t' (tab),
          etc are interpreted in double quoted strings but not single
          quoted strings. This difference is important on Windows
          platforms where the "\" character is used in path names, and
          so single quoted strings should be used in paths. MATLAB
          doesn't have double quoted strings and so they should be
          avoided if the code will be transferred to a MATLAB user.
