15.2.1.1 Axis Configuration
...........................

The axis function may be used to change the axis limits of an existing
plot and various other axis properties, such as the aspect ratio and the
appearance of tic marks.

 -- Function File:  axis ()
 -- Function File:  axis ([X_lo X_hi])
 -- Function File:  axis ([X_lo X_hi Y_lo Y_hi])
 -- Function File:  axis ([X_lo X_hi Y_lo Y_hi Z_lo Z_hi])
 -- Function File:  axis (OPTION)
 -- Function File:  axis (..., OPTION)
 -- Function File:  axis (H, ...)
 -- Function File: LIMITS = axis ()
     Set axis limits for plots.

     The argument LIMITS should be a 2-, 4-, or 6-element vector.  The
     first and second elements specify the lower and upper limits for
     the x-axis.  The third and fourth specify the limits for the
     y-axis, and the fifth and sixth specify the limits for the z-axis.

     Without any arguments, `axis' turns autoscaling on.

     With one output argument, `x = axis' returns the current axes.

     The vector argument specifying limits is optional, and additional
     string arguments may be used to specify various axis properties.
     For example,

          axis ([1, 2, 3, 4], "square");

     forces a square aspect ratio, and

          axis ("tic", "labely");

     turns tic marks on for all axes and tic mark labels on for the
     y-axis only.

     The following options control the aspect ratio of the axes.

    "square"
          Force a square aspect ratio.

    "equal"
          Force x distance to equal y-distance.

    "normal"
          Restore the balance.

     The following options control the way axis limits are interpreted.

    "auto"
          Set the specified axes to have nice limits around the data or
          all if no axes are specified.

    "manual"
          Fix the current axes limits.

    "tight"
          Fix axes to the limits of the data.

     The option `"image"' is equivalent to `"tight"' and `"equal"'.

     The following options affect the appearance of tic marks.

    "on"
          Turn tic marks and labels on for all axes.

    "off"
          Turn tic marks off for all axes.

    "tic[xyz]"
          Turn tic marks on for all axes, or turn them on for the
          specified axes and off for the remainder.

    "label[xyz]"
          Turn tic labels on for all axes, or turn them on for the
          specified axes and off for the remainder.

    "nolabel"
          Turn tic labels off for all axes.
     Note, if there are no tic marks for an axis, there can be no
     labels.

     The following options affect the direction of increasing values on
     the axes.

    "ij"
          Reverse y-axis, so lower values are nearer the top.

    "xy"
          Restore y-axis, so higher values are nearer the top.

     If an axes handle is passed as the first argument, then operate on
     this axes rather than the current axes.

   Similarly the axis limits of the colormap can be changed with the
caxis function.

 -- Function File:  caxis (LIMITS)
 -- Function File:  caxis (H, ...)
     Set color axis limits for plots.

     The argument LIMITS should be a 2-element vector specifying the
     lower and upper limits to assign to the first and last value in the
     colormap.  Values outside this range are clamped to the first and
     last colormap entries.

     If LIMITS is "auto", then automatic colormap scaling is applied,
     whereas if LIMITS is "manual" the colormap scaling is set to
     manual.

     Called without any arguments to current color axis limits are
     returned.

     If an axes handle is passed as the first argument, then operate on
     this axes rather than the current axes.

   The `xlim', `ylim', and `zlim' functions may be used to get or set
individual axis limits.  Each has the same form.

 -- Function File: XL = xlim ()
 -- Function File:  xlim (XL)
 -- Function File: M = xlim ("mode")
 -- Function File:  xlim (M)
 -- Function File:  xlim (H, ...)
     Get or set the limits of the x-axis of the current plot.  Called
     without arguments `xlim' returns the x-axis limits of the current
     plot.  If passed a two element vector XL, the limits of the x-axis
     are set to this value.

     The current mode for calculation of the x-axis can be returned
     with a call `xlim ("mode")', and can be either "auto" or "manual".
     The current plotting mode can be set by passing either "auto" or
     "manual" as the argument.

     If passed a handle as the first argument, then operate on this
     handle rather than the current axes handle.

15.2.1.2 Two-dimensional Function Plotting
..........................................

Octave can plot a function from a function handle inline function or
string defining the function without the user needing to explicitly
create the data to be plotted.  The function `fplot' also generates
two-dimensional plots with linear axes using a function name and limits
for the range of the x-coordinate instead of the x and y data.  For
example,

     fplot (@sin, [-10, 10], 201);

produces a plot that is equivalent to the one above, but also includes a
legend displaying the name of the plotted function.

 -- Function File:  fplot (FN, LIMITS)
 -- Function File:  fplot (FN, LIMITS, TOL)
 -- Function File:  fplot (FN, LIMITS, N)
 -- Function File:  fplot (..., FMT)
     Plot a function FN within defined limits.  FN is a function
     handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the
     function to evaluate.  The limits of the plot are given by LIMITS
     of the form `[XLO, XHI]' or `[XLO, XHI, YLO, YHI]'.  TOL is the
     default tolerance to use for the plot, and if TOL is an integer it
     is assumed that it defines the number points to use in the plot.
     The FMT argument is passed to the plot command.

          fplot ("cos", [0, 2*pi])
          fplot ("[cos(x), sin(x)]", [0, 2*pi])

     *See also:* *note plot: doc-plot.

   Other functions that can create two-dimensional plots directly from a
function include `ezplot', `ezcontour', `ezcontourf' and `ezpolar'.

 -- Function File:  ezplot (F)
 -- Function File:  ezplot (FX, FY)
 -- Function File:  ezplot (..., DOM)
 -- Function File:  ezplot (..., N)
 -- Function File:  ezplot (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = ezplot (...)
     Plot the curve defined by F in two dimensions.  The function F may
     be a string, inline function or function handle and can have
     either one or two variables.  If F has one variable, then the
     function is plotted over the domain `-2*pi < X < 2*pi' with 500
     points.

     If F has two variables then `F(X,Y) = 0' is calculated over the
     meshed domain `-2*pi < X | Y < 2*pi' with 60 by 60 in the mesh.
     For example:

          ezplot (@(X, Y) X.^2 - Y.^2 - 1)

     If two functions are passed as strings, inline functions or
     function handles, then the parametric function

          X = FX (T)
          Y = FY (T)

     is plotted over the domain `-2*pi < T < 2*pi' with 500 points.

     If DOM is a two element vector, it represents the minimum and
     maximum value of X, Y and T.  If it is a four element vector, then
     the minimum and maximum values of X and T are determined by the
     first two elements and the minimum and maximum of Y by the second
     pair of elements.

     N is a scalar defining the number of points to use in plotting the
     function.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     plot.

     *See also:* *note plot: doc-plot, *note ezplot3: doc-ezplot3.

 -- Function File:  ezcontour (F)
 -- Function File:  ezcontour (..., DOM)
 -- Function File:  ezcontour (..., N)
 -- Function File:  ezcontour (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = ezcontour (...)
     Plot the contour lines of a function.  F is a string, inline
     function or function handle with two arguments defining the
     function.  By default the plot is over the domain `-2*pi < X <
     2*pi' and `-2*pi < Y < 2*pi' with 60 points in each dimension.

     If DOM is a two element vector, it represents the minimum and
     maximum value of both X and Y.  If DOM is a four element vector,
     then the minimum and maximum value of X and Y are specify
     separately.

     N is a scalar defining the number of points to use in each
     dimension.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     plot.

          f = @(x,y) sqrt (abs (x .* y)) ./ (1 + x.^2 + y.^2);
          ezcontour (f, [-3, 3]);

 -- Function File:  ezcontourf (..., DOM)
 -- Function File:  ezcontourf (..., N)
 -- Function File:  ezcontourf (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = ezcontourf (...)
     Plot the filled contour lines of a function.  F is a string, inline
     function or function handle with two arguments defining the
     function.  By default the plot is over the domain `-2*pi < X <
     2*pi' and `-2*pi < Y < 2*pi' with 60 points in each dimension.

     If DOM is a two element vector, it represents the minimum and
     maximum value of both X and Y.  If DOM is a four element vector,
     then the minimum and maximum value of X and Y are specify
     separately.

     N is a scalar defining the number of points to use in each
     dimension.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     plot.

          f = @(x,y) sqrt (abs (x .* y)) ./ (1 + x.^2 + y.^2);

 -- Function File:  ezpolar (F)
 -- Function File:  ezpolar (..., DOM)
 -- Function File:  ezpolar (..., N)
 -- Function File:  ezpolar (HAX, ...)
 -- Function File: H = ezpolar (...)
     Plot a function in polar coordinates.  The function F is a string,
     inline function, or function handle with a single argument.  The
     expected form of the function is `RHO = F(THETA)'.  By default the
     plot is over the domain `0 < THETA < 2*pi' with 60 points.

     If DOM is a two element vector, it represents the minimum and
     maximum values of THETA.  N is a scalar defining the number of
     points to use.  If the optional input HAX is given then the plot
     is placed into the specified axes rather than the current axes.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     plot.

     Example:

          ezpolar (@(t) 1 + sin (t));

 -- Function File:  rectangle (..., "Curvature", CURV)
 -- Function File:  rectangle (..., "EdgeColor", EC)
 -- Function File:  rectangle (..., "FaceColor", FC)
 -- Function File: H = rectangle (...)
     Draw rectangular patch defined by POS and CURV.  The variable
     `POS(1:2)' defines the lower left-hand corner of the patch and
     `POS(3:4)' defines its width and height.  By default, the value of
     POS is `[0, 0, 1, 1]'.

     The variable CURV defines the curvature of the sides of the
     rectangle and may be a scalar or two-element vector with values
     between 0 and 1.  A value of 0 represents no curvature of the
     side, whereas a value of 1 means that the side is entirely curved
     into the arc of a circle.  If CURV is a two-element vector, then
     the first element is the curvature along the x-axis of the patch
     and the second along y-axis.

     If CURV is a scalar, it represents the curvature of the shorter of
     the two sides of the rectangle and the curvature of the other side
     is defined by

          min (pos (1:2)) / max (pos (1:2)) * curv

     Other properties are passed to the underlying patch command.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     rectangle object.

15.2.2 Three-Dimensional Plots
------------------------------

The function `mesh' produces mesh surface plots.  For example,

     tx = ty = linspace (-8, 8, 41)';
     [xx, yy] = meshgrid (tx, ty);
     r = sqrt (xx .^ 2 + yy .^ 2) + eps;
     tz = sin (r) ./ r;
     mesh (tx, ty, tz);

produces the familiar "sombrero" plot shown in *note fig:mesh::.  Note
the use of the function `meshgrid' to create matrices of X and Y
coordinates to use for plotting the Z data.  The `ndgrid' function is
similar to `meshgrid', but works for N-dimensional matrices.


+---------------------------------+
| Image unavailable in text mode. |
+---------------------------------+
Figure 15.5: Mesh plot.

   The `meshc' function is similar to `mesh', but also produces a plot
of contours for the surface.

   The `plot3' function displays arbitrary three-dimensional data,
without requiring it to form a surface.  For example,

     t = 0:0.1:10*pi;
     r = linspace (0, 1, numel (t));
     z = linspace (0, 1, numel (t));
     plot3 (r.*sin(t), r.*cos(t), z);

displays the spiral in three dimensions shown in *note fig:plot3::.

   Finally, the `view' function changes the viewpoint for
three-dimensional plots.

     Plot a mesh given matrices X, and Y from `meshgrid' and a matrix Z
     corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of the mesh.  If X and Y
     are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), Z(i,j)).  Thus,

     correspond to different Y values.

     The color of the mesh is derived from the `colormap' and the value
     of Z.  Optionally the color of the mesh can be specified
     independent of Z, by adding a fourth matrix, C.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created

     The light direction can be specified using L.  It can be given as a
     2-element vector [azimuth, elevation] in degrees or as a 3-element
     vector [lx, ly, lz].  The default value is rotated 45 degrees
     counterclockwise from the current view.

     The material properties of the surface can specified using a
     4-element vector P = [AM D SP EXP] which defaults to P = [0.55 0.6
     0.4 10].

    "AM" strength of ambient light

    "D" strength of diffuse reflection

    "SP" strength of specular reflection

    "EXP" specular exponent

     The default lighting mode "cdata", changes the cdata property to
     give the impression of a lighted surface.  Please note: the
     alternative "light" mode, which creates a light object to
     illuminate the surface is not implemented (yet).

     Find the vectors normal to a meshgridded surface.  The meshed
     gridded surface is defined by X, Y, and Z.  If X and Y are not
     defined, then it is assumed that they are given by

          [X, Y] = meshgrid (1:size (Z, 1),
                             1:size (Z, 2));

     If no return arguments are requested, a surface plot with the
     normal vectors to the surface is plotted.  Otherwise the
     components of the normal vectors at the mesh gridded points are
     returned in NX, NY, and NZ.

     The normal vectors are calculated by taking the cross product of
     the diagonals of each of the quadrilaterals in the meshgrid to
     find the normal vectors of the centers of these quadrilaterals.
     The four nearest normal vectors to the meshgrid points are then
     averaged to obtain the normal to the surface at the meshgridded
     points.

     An example of the use of `surfnorm' is

          surfnorm (peaks (25));

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument
     VAL is a three-dimensional array that contains the data of an
     isosurface geometry and the second input argument ISO keeps the
     isovalue as a scalar value then return a structure array FV that
     contains the fields FACES and VERTICES at computed points `[x, y,
     z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument FV can
     directly be taken as an input argument for the `patch' function.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are
     three-dimensional arrays with the same size than VAL then the
     volume data is taken at those given points.

     The string input argument "noshare" is only for compatibility and
     has no effect.  If given the string input argument "verbose" then
     print messages to the command line interface about the current
     progress.

     If called with the input argument COL which is a three-dimensional
     array of the same size than VAL then take those values for the
     interpolation of coloring the isosurface geometry.  Add the field
     FACEVERTEXCDATA to the structure array FV.

     If called with two or three output arguments then return the
     information about the faces F, vertices V and color data C as
     seperate arrays instead of a single structure array.

     If called with no output argument then directly process the
     isosurface geometry with the `patch' command.

     For example,

          [x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:5, 1:5, 1:5);
          val = rand (5, 5, 5);
          isosurface (x, y, z, val, .5);

     will directly draw a random isosurface geometry in a graphics
     window.  Another example for an isosurface geometry with different
     additional coloring

          N = 15;    # Increase number of vertices in each direction

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument
     VAL is a three-dimensional array that contains the data for an
     isosurface geometry and the second input argument V keeps the
     vertices of an isosurface then return the normals N in form of a

 -- Function File: NFV = shrinkfaces (F, V, SF)
 -- Function File: [NF, NV] = shrinkfaces (...)
     Reduce the faces area for a given patch, structure or explicit
     faces and points matrices by a scale factor SF.  The structure FV
     must contain the fields 'faces' and 'vertices'.  If the factor SF
     is omitted then a default of 0.3 is used.

     Given a patch handle as the first input argument and no output
     parameters, perform the shrinking of the patch faces in place and
     redraw the patch.

     If called with one output argument, return a structure with fields
     'faces', 'vertices', and 'facevertexcdata' containing the data
     after shrinking which can then directly be used as an input
     argument for the `patch' function.

     Performing the shrinking on faces which are not convex can lead to
     undesired results.

     For example,

          [phi r] = meshgrid (linspace (0, 1.5*pi, 16), linspace (1, 2, 4));
          tri = delaunay (phi(:), r(:));
          v = [r(:).*sin(phi(:)) r(:).*cos(phi(:))];
          clf ()

     Calculate specular reflection strength of a surface defined by the
     normal vector elements SX, SY, SZ using Phong's approximation.
     The light and view vectors can be specified using parameter LV and
     VV respectively.  Both can be given as 2-element vectors [azimuth,
     elevation] in degrees or as 3-element vector [x, y, z].  An
     optional 6th argument describes the specular exponent (spread) SE.

 -- Function File: [XX, YY, ZZ] = meshgrid (X, Y, Z)
 -- Function File: [XX, YY] = meshgrid (X, Y)
 -- Function File: [XX, YY] = meshgrid (X)
     Given vectors of X and Y and Z coordinates, and returning 3
     arguments, return three-dimensional arrays corresponding to the X,
     Y, and Z coordinates of a mesh.  When returning only 2 arguments,
     return matrices corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of a
     mesh.  The rows of XX are copies of X, and the columns of YY are
     copies of Y.  If Y is omitted, then it is assumed to be the same
     as X, and Z is assumed the same as Y.

 -- Function File: [Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X1, X2, ..., Xn)
 -- Function File: [Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X)
     Given n vectors X1, ... Xn, `ndgrid' returns n arrays of dimension
     n.  The elements of the i-th output argument contains the elements
     of the vector Xi repeated over all dimensions different from the
     i-th dimension.  Calling ndgrid with only one input argument X is
     equivalent of calling ndgrid with all n input arguments equal to X:

     [Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X, ..., X)

 -- Function File:  plot3 (ARGS)
     Produce three-dimensional plots.  Many different combinations of
     arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot3 (X, Y, Z)

     in which the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points
     to be plotted in three dimensions.  If all arguments are vectors
     of the same length, then a single continuous line is drawn.  If
     all arguments are matrices, then each column of the matrices is
     treated as a separate line.  No attempt is made to transpose the
     arguments to make the number of rows match.

     If only two arguments are given, as

          plot3 (X, C)

     the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as
     the Y and Z coordinates, respectively.

     If only one argument is given, as

          plot3 (C)

     the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the Y and
     Z values, and they are plotted versus their index.

     Arguments may also be given in groups of three as

          plot3 (X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...)

     in which each set of three arguments is treated as a separate line
     or set of lines in three dimensions.

     To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group
     with an empty format string, as

          plot3 (X1, C1, "", C2, "", ...)

     An example of the use of `plot3' is

          z = [0:0.05:5];
          plot3 (cos (2*pi*z), sin (2*pi*z), z, ";helix;");
          plot3 (z, exp (2i*pi*z), ";complex sinusoid;");

     AZIMUTH and ELEVATION can be given as two arguments or as
     2-element vector.  The viewpoint can also be given with Cartesian
     coordinates X, Y, and Z.  The call `view (2)' sets the viewpoint
     to AZIMUTH = 0 and ELEVATION = 90, which is the default for 2-D
     graphs.  The call `view (3)' sets the viewpoint to AZIMUTH = -37.5
     and ELEVATION = 30, which is the default for 3-D graphs.  If AX is
     given, the viewpoint is set for this axes, otherwise it is set for
     the current axes.

 -- Function File: H = slice (..., METHOD)
     Plot slices of 3-D data/scalar fields.  Each element of the
     3-dimensional array V represents a scalar value at a location
     given by the parameters X, Y, and Z.  The parameters X, X, and Z
     are either 3-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in
     the "meshgrid" format or vectors.  The parameters XI, etc. respect
     a similar format to X, etc., and they represent the points at
     which the array VI is interpolated using interp3.  The vectors SX,
     SY, and SZ contain points of orthogonal slices of the respective
     axes.

     If X, Y, Z are omitted, they are assumed to be `x = 1:size (V,
     2)', `y = 1:size (V, 1)' and `z = 1:size (V, 3)'.

     METHOD is one of:

    "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    "linear"
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors (not
          implemented yet).

    "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second
          derivatives throughout the curve.

     The default method is `"linear"'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     surface object.

     Examples:

          [x, y, z] = meshgrid (linspace (-8, 8, 32));
          v = sin (sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2)) ./ (sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2));

 -- Function File:  ribbon (X, Y, WIDTH)
 -- Function File:  ribbon (Y)
 -- Function File: H = ribbon (...)
     Plot a ribbon plot for the columns of Y vs.  X.  The optional
     parameter WIDTH specifies the width of a single ribbon (default is
     0.75).  If X is omitted, a vector containing the row numbers is
     assumed (1:rows(Y)).

     The optional return value H is a vector of graphics handles to the
     surface objects representing each ribbon.

 -- Function File:  shading (TYPE)
 -- Function File:  shading (AX, ...)
     Set the shading of surface or patch graphic objects.  Valid
     arguments for TYPE are

    "flat"
          Single colored patches with invisible edges.

    "faceted"
          Single colored patches with visible edges.

    "interp"
          Color between patch vertices are interpolated and the patch
          edges are invisible.

     If AX is given the shading is applied to axis AX instead of the
     current axis.

 -- Function File: H = scatter3 (...)
     Plot a scatter plot of the data in 3D.  A marker is plotted at
     each point defined by the points in the vectors X, Y and Z.  The
     size of the markers used is determined by S, which can be a scalar
     or a vector of the same length of X, Y and Z.  If S is not given
     or is an empty matrix, then the default value of 8 points is used.

     The color of the markers is determined by C, which can be a string
     defining a fixed color; a 3-element vector giving the red, green,
     and blue components of the color; a vector of the same length as X
     that gives a scaled index into the current colormap; or a N-by-3
     matrix defining the colors of each of the markers individually.

     The marker to use can be changed with the STYLE argument, that is a
     string defining a marker in the same manner as the `plot' command.
     If the argument "filled" is given then the markers as filled.  All
     additional arguments are passed to the underlying patch command.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the hggroup
     object representing the points.

     Plot a parametrically defined curve in three dimensions.  FX, FY,
     and FZ are strings, inline functions or function handles with one
     arguments defining the function.  By default the plot is over the
     domain `-2*pi < X < 2*pi' with 60 points.

     If DOM is a two element vector, it represents the minimum and
     maximum value of T.  N is a scalar defining the number of points
     to use.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     plot.

15.2.3 Plot Annotations
-----------------------

You can add titles, axis labels, legends, and arbitrary text to an
existing plot.  For example:

     x = -10:0.1:10;
     plot (x, sin (x));
     title ("sin(x) for x = -10:0.1:10");
     xlabel ("x");
     ylabel ("sin (x)");
     text (pi, 0.7, "arbitrary text");
     legend ("sin (x)");

   The functions `grid' and `box' may also be used to add grid and
border lines to the plot.  By default, the grid is off and the border
lines are on.

 -- Function File:  title (STRING)
 -- Function File:  title (STRING, P1, V1, ...)
 -- Function File:  title (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = title (...)
     Create a title object for a plot.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     object.

 -- Function File:  legend (HAX, ...)
 -- Function File:  legend (HOBJS, ...)
 -- Function File:  legend (HAX, HOBJS, ...)
 -- Function File:  legend ("OPTION")
     Display a legend for the axes with handle HAX, or the current axes,
     using the specified strings as labels.  Legend entries may be
     specified as individual character string arguments, a character
     array, or a cell array of character strings.  If the handles,
     HOBJS, are not specified then the legend's strings will be
     associated with the axes' descendants.  Legend works on line
     graphs, bar graphs, etc.  A plot must exist before legend is
     called.

     The optional parameter POS specifies the location of the legend as
     follows:

          POS        location of the legend
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
          north      center top
          south      center bottom
          east       right center
          west       left center
          northeast  right top (default)
          northwest  left top
          southeast  right bottom
          southwest  left bottom

          outside    can be appended to any location string

     The optional parameter ORIENT determines if the key elements are
     placed vertically or horizontally.  The allowed values are
     "vertical" or "horizontal" with the default being "vertical".

     The following customizations are available using OPTION:

    "show"
          Show legend on the plot

    "hide"
          Hide legend on the plot

    "toggle"
          Toggles between "hide" and "show"

 -- Function File:  clabel (..., PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- Function File: H = clabel (...)
     Add labels to the contours of a contour plot.  The contour plot is
     specified by the contour matrix C and optionally the contourgroup
     object H that are returned by `contour', `contourf' and `contour3'.
     The contour labels are rotated and placed in the contour itself.

     By default, all contours are labeled.  However, the contours to
     label can be specified by the vector V.  If the "manual" argument
     is given then the contours to label can be selected with the mouse.

     Additional property/value pairs that are valid properties of text
     objects can be given and are passed to the underlying text
     objects.  Additionally, the property "LabelSpacing" is available
     allowing the spacing between labels on a contour (in points) to be
     specified.  The default is 144 points, or 2 inches.

     The optional return value H is a vector of graphics handles to the
     text objects representing each label.  The "userdata" property of
     the text objects contains the numerical value of the contour label.

     An example of the use of `clabel' is

          [c, h] = contour (peaks (), -4 : 6);
          clabel (c, h, -4:2:6, "fontsize", 12);

     state is toggled.

     If ARG is `"minor"' then the minor grid is toggled.  When using a
     minor grid a second argument ARG2 is allowed, which can be either
     `"on"' or `"off"' to explicitly set the state of the minor grid.

     If the first argument is an axis handle, HAX, operate on the
     specified axis object.

     *See also:* *note plot: doc-plot.

 -- Function File:  colorbar (S)

     Add a colorbar to the current axes.  Valid values for S are

    "EastOutside"
          Place the colorbar outside the plot to the right.  This is
          the default.

    "East"
          Place the colorbar inside the plot to the right.

    "WestOutside"
          Place the colorbar outside the plot to the left.

    "West"
          Place the colorbar inside the plot to the left.

    "NorthOutside"
          Place the colorbar above the plot.

    "North"
          Place the colorbar at the top of the plot.

    "SouthOutside"
          Place the colorbar under the plot.

    "South"
          Place the colorbar at the bottom of the plot.

    "Off", "None"
          Remove any existing colorbar from the plot.

     If the argument "peer" is given, then the following argument is
     treated as the axes handle on which to add the colorbar.


File: octave.info,  Node: Multiple Plots on One Page,  Next: Multiple Plot Windows,  Prev: Plot Annotations,  Up: High-Level Plotting

15.2.4 Multiple Plots on One Page
---------------------------------

Octave can display more than one plot in a single figure.  The simplest
way to do this is to use the `subplot' function to divide the plot area
into a series of subplot windows that are indexed by an integer.  For
example,

     subplot (2, 1, 1)
     fplot (@sin, [-10, 10]);
     subplot (2, 1, 2)
     fplot (@cos, [-10, 10]);

creates a figure with two separate axes, one displaying a sine wave and
the other a cosine wave.  The first call to subplot divides the figure
into two plotting areas (two rows and one column) and makes the first
plot area active.  The grid of plot areas created by `subplot' is
numbered in column-major order (top to bottom, left to right).

 -- Function File:  subplot (ROWS, COLS, INDEX)
 -- Function File:  subplot (RCN)
     Set up a plot grid with ROWS by COLS subwindows and plot in
     location given by INDEX.

     If only one argument is supplied, then it must be a three digit
     value specifying the location in digits 1 (rows) and 2 (columns)
     and the plot index in digit 3.

     The plot index runs row-wise.  First all the columns in a row are
     filled and then the next row is filled.

     For example, a plot with 2 by 3 grid will have plot indices
     running as follows:

          +-----+-----+-----+
          |  1  |  2  |  3  |
          +-----+-----+-----+
          |  4  |  5  |  6  |
          +-----+-----+-----+

     INDEX may be a vector.  In which case, the new axis will enclose
     the grid locations specified.  The first demo illustrates an
     example:

          demo ("subplot", 1)

File: octave.info,  Node: Multiple Plot Windows,  Next: Printing and Saving Plots,  Prev: Multiple Plots on One Page,  Up: High-Level Plotting

15.2.5 Multiple Plot Windows
----------------------------

You can open multiple plot windows using the `figure' function.  For
example,

     figure (1);
     fplot (@sin, [-10, 10]);
     figure (2);
     fplot (@cos, [-10, 10]);

creates two figures, with the first displaying a sine wave and the
second a cosine wave.  Figure numbers must be positive integers.

 -- Command:  figure
 -- Command:  figure N
 -- Function File:  figure (N)
 -- Function File:  figure (N, "PROPERTY", VALUE, ...)
     Set the current plot window to plot window N.  If no arguments are
     specified, the next available window number is chosen.

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified for the figure, but
     they must appear in pairs.

15.2.6 Use of `axis',  `line', and `patch' functions
----------------------------------------------------

You can create axes, line, and patch objects directly using the `axes',
`line', and `patch' functions.  These objects become children of the
current axes object.

 -- Function File:  axes ()
 -- Function File:  axes (PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- Function File:  axes (H)
     Create an axes object and return a handle to it.

 -- Function File:  line ()
 -- Function File:  line (X, Y)
 -- Function File:  line (X, Y, Z)
 -- Function File:  line (X, Y, Z, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
     Create line object from X and Y and insert in current axes object.
     Return a handle (or vector of handles) to the line objects created.

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified for the line, but
     they must appear in pairs.

 -- Function File:  patch ()
 -- Function File:  patch (X, Y, C)
 -- Function File:  patch (X, Y, Z, C)
 -- Function File:  patch (FV)
 -- Function File:  patch ("Faces", F, "Vertices", V, ...)
 -- Function File:  patch (..., PROP, VAL)
 -- Function File:  patch (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = patch (...)
     Create patch object from X and Y with color C and insert in the
     current axes object.  Return handle to patch object.

     For a uniform colored patch, C can be given as an RGB vector,
     scalar value referring to the current colormap, or string value
     (for example, "r" or "red").

     If passed a structure FV contain the fields "vertices", "faces"
     and optionally "facevertexcdata", create the patch based on these
     properties.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     patch object.

     *See also:* *note fill: doc-fill.

 -- Function File:  fill (X, Y, C)
 -- Function File:  fill (X1, Y1, C1, X2, Y2, C2)
 -- Function File:  fill (..., PROP, VAL)
 -- Function File:  fill (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = fill (...)
     Create one or more filled patch objects.

     The optional return value H is an array of graphics handles to the
     created patch objects.

     *See also:* *note patch: doc-patch.

 -- Function File:  surface (X, Y, Z, C)
 -- Function File:  surface (X, Y, Z)
 -- Function File:  surface (Z, C)
 -- Function File:  surface (Z)
 -- Function File:  surface (..., PROP, VAL)
 -- Function File:  surface (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = surface (...)
     Plot a surface graphic object given matrices X, and Y from
     `meshgrid' and a matrix Z corresponding to the X and Y coordinates
     of the surface.  If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is
     (X(j), Y(i), Z(i,j)).  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different
     X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.  If X and
     Y are missing, they are constructed from size of the matrix Z.

     Any additional properties passed are assigned to the surface.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created
     surface object.

15.2.7 Manipulation of plot windows
-----------------------------------

By default, Octave refreshes the plot window when a prompt is printed,
or when waiting for input.  The `drawnow' function is used to cause a
plot window to be updated.

 -- Built-in Function:  drawnow ()
 -- Built-in Function:  drawnow ("expose")
 -- Built-in Function:  drawnow (TERM, FILE, MONO, DEBUG_FILE)
     Update figure windows and their children.  The event queue is
     flushed and any callbacks generated are executed.  With the
     optional argument `"expose"', only graphic objects are updated and
     no other events or callbacks are processed.  The third calling
     form of `drawnow' is for debugging and is undocumented.

   Only figures that are modified will be updated.  The `refresh'
function can also be used to force an update of the current figure,
even if it is not modified.

 -- Function File:  refresh ()
 -- Function File:  refresh (H)
     Refresh a figure, forcing it to be redrawn.  When called without an
     argument the current figure is redrawn.  Otherwise, the figure
     pointed to by H is redrawn.

     *See also:* *note drawnow: doc-drawnow.

   Normally, high-level plot functions like `plot' or `mesh' call
`newplot' to initialize the state of the current axes so that the next
plot is drawn in a blank window with default property settings.  To
have two plots superimposed over one another, use the `hold' function.
For example,

     hold on;
     x = -10:0.1:10;
     plot (x, sin (x));
     plot (x, cos (x));
     hold off;

displays sine and cosine waves on the same axes.  If the hold state is
off, consecutive plotting commands like this will only display the last
plot.

 -- Function File:  newplot ()
     Prepare graphics engine to produce a new plot.  This function is
     called at the beginning of all high-level plotting functions.  It
     is not normally required in user programs.

 -- Command:  hold
 -- Command:  hold STATE
 -- Function File:  hold (HAX, ...)
     Toggle or set the "hold" state of the plotting engine which
     determines whether new graphic objects are added to the plot or
     replace the existing objects.

    `hold on'
          Retain plot data and settings so that subsequent plot
          commands are displayed on a single graph.

    `hold all'
          Retain plot line color, line style, data and settings so that
          subsequent plot commands are displayed on a single graph with
          the next line color and style.

    `hold off'
          Clear plot and restore default graphics settings before each
          new plot command.  (default).

    `hold'
          Toggle the current hold state.

     When given the additional argument HAX, the hold state is modified
     only for the given axis handle.

     To query the current hold state use the `ishold' function.

     *See also:* *note ishold: doc-ishold, *note cla: doc-cla, *note
     newplot: doc-newplot, *note clf: doc-clf.

 -- Command:  ishold
 -- Function File:  ishold (H)
     Return true if the next plot will be added to the current plot, or
     false if the plot device will be cleared before drawing the next
     plot.

     Optionally, operate on the graphics handle H rather than the
     current plot.

     *See also:* *note hold: doc-hold.

   To clear the current figure, call the `clf' function.  To clear the
current axis, call the `cla' function.  To bring the current figure to
the top of the window stack, call the `shg' function.  To delete a
graphics object, call `delete' on its index.  To close the figure
window, call the `close' function.

 -- Function File:  clf ()
 -- Function File:  clf ("reset")
 -- Function File:  clf (HFIG)
 -- Function File:  clf (HFIG, "reset")
 -- Function File: H = clf (...)
     Clear the current figure window.  `clf' operates by deleting child
     graphics objects with visible handles (`handlevisibility' = on).
     If HFIG is specified operate on it instead of the current figure.
     If the optional argument `"reset"' is specified, all objects
     including those with hidden handles are deleted.

     The optional return value H is the graphics handle of the figure
     window that was cleared.

     *See also:* *note cla: doc-cla, *note close: doc-close, *note
     delete: doc-delete.

 -- Function File:  cla ()
 -- Function File:  cla ("reset")
 -- Function File:  cla (HAX)
 -- Function File:  cla (HAX, "reset")
     Delete the children of the current axes with visible handles.  If
     HAX is specified and is an axes object handle, operate on it
     instead of the current axes.  If the optional argument `"reset"'
     is specified, also delete the children with hidden handles.

     *See also:* *note clf: doc-clf.

 -- Command:  shg
     Show the graph window.  Currently, this is the same as executing
     `drawnow'.

     *See also:* *note drawnow: doc-drawnow, *note figure: doc-figure.

 -- Function File:  delete (FILE)
 -- Function File:  delete (HANDLE)
     Delete the named file or graphics handle.

     Deleting graphics objects is the proper way to remove features
     from a plot without clearing the entire figure.

     *See also:* *note clf: doc-clf, *note cla: doc-cla, *note unlink:
     doc-unlink.

 -- Command:  close
 -- Command:  close (N)
 -- Command:  close all
 -- Command:  close all hidden
     Close figure window(s) by calling the function specified by the
     `"closerequestfcn"' property for each figure.  By default, the
     function `closereq' is used.

     *See also:* *note closereq: doc-closereq.

 -- Function File:  closereq ()
     Close the current figure and delete all graphics objects associated
     with it.

     *See also:* *note close: doc-close, *note delete: doc-delete.

15.2.8 Use of the `interpreter' Property
----------------------------------------

All text objects, including titles, labels, legends, and text, include
the property 'interpreter', this property determines the manner in which
special control sequences in the text are rendered.  If the interpreter
is set to 'none', then no rendering occurs.  At this point the 'latex'
option is not implemented and so the 'latex' interpreter also does not
interpret the text.

   The 'tex' option implements a subset of TeX functionality in the
rendering of the text.  This allows the insertion of special characters
such as Greek or mathematical symbols within the text.  The special
characters are also inserted with a code starting with the back-slash
(\) character, as in the table *note tab:extended::.

   In addition, the formatting of the text can be changed within the
string with the codes

               \bf            Bold font                                   
               \it            Italic font                                 
               \sl            Oblique Font                                
               \rm            Normal font                                 

   These are be used in conjunction with the { and } characters to limit
the change in the font to part of the string.  For example,

     xlabel ('{\bf H} = a {\bf V}')

where the character 'a' will not appear in a bold font.  Note that to
avoid having Octave interpret the backslash characters in the strings,
the strings should be in single quotes.

   It is also possible to change the fontname and size within the text

        \fontname{FONTNAME}           Specify the font to use                     
        \fontsize{SIZE}               Specify the size of the font to use         

   Finally, the superscript and subscripting can be controlled with the
'^' and '_' characters.  If the '^' or '_' is followed by a { character,
then all of the block surrounded by the { } pair is super- or
sub-scripted.  Without the { } pair, only the character immediately
following the '^' or '_' is super- or sub-scripted.

          \forall            \exists            \ni

15.2.9 Printing and Saving Plots
--------------------------------

The `print' command allows you to send plots to you printer and to save
plots in a variety of formats.  For example,

     print -dpsc

prints the current figure to a color PostScript printer. And,

     print -deps foo.eps

saves the current figure to an encapsulated PostScript file called
`foo.eps'.

 -- Function File:  print ()
 -- Function File:  print (OPTIONS)
 -- Function File:  print (FILENAME, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File:  print (H, FILENAME, OPTIONS)
     Print a graph, or save it to a file.  Both output formatted for
     printing (PDF and PostScript), and many bitmapped and vector image
     formats are supported.

     H specifies the figure handle.  If no handle is specified the
     handle for the current figure is used.

     FILENAME defines the name of the output file.  If the file name
     has no suffix, one is inferred from the specified device and
     appended to the file name.  If no filename is specified, the
     output is sent to the printer.

     For output to a printer, to a PostScript file, or a PDF file, the
     paper size is specified by the figure's `papersize' property.  The
     location and size of the image on the page are specified by the
     figure's `paperposition' property.  The orientation of the page is
     specified by the figure's `paperorientation' property.

     The width and height of images are specified by the figure's
     `paperpositon(3:4)' property values.

     The `print' command supports several OPTIONS:

    `-fH'
          Specify the handle, H, of the figure to be printed.  The
          default is the current figure.

    `-PPRINTER'
          Set the PRINTER name to which the graph is sent if no
          FILENAME is specified.

    `-GGHOSTSCRIPT_COMMAND'
          Specify the command for calling Ghostscript.  For Unix and
          Windows, the defaults are 'gs' and 'gswin32c', respectively.

    `-color'
    `-mono'
          Monochrome or color output.

    `-solid'
    `-dashed'
          Forces all lines to be solid or dashed, respectively.

    `-portrait'
    `-landscape'
          Specify the orientation of the plot for printed output.  For
          non-printed output the aspect ratio of the output corresponds
          to the plot area defined by the "paperposition" property in
          the orientation specified.  This options is equivalent to
          changing the figure's "paperorientation" property.

    `-TextAlphaBits=N'
    `-GraphicsAlphaBits=N'
          Octave is able to produce output for various printers,
          bitmaps, and vector formats by using ghostscript.  For bitmap
          and printer output antialiasing is applied using
          ghostscript's TextAlphaBits and GraphicsAlphaBits options.
          The default number of bits for each is 4.  Allowed values,
          for N, are 1, 2, or 4.

    `-dDEVICE'
          The available output format is specified by the option DEVICE,
           and is one of:

         `ps'
         `ps2'
         `psc'
         `psc2'
               Postscript (level 1 and 2, mono and color).  The FLTK
               graphics     toolkit generates Postscript level 3.0.

         `eps'
         `eps2'
         `epsc'
         `epsc2'
               Encapsulated postscript (level 1 and 2, mono and color).
               The FLTK graphic toolkit generates Postscript level 3.0.

         `tex'
         `epslatex'
         `epslatexstandalone'
         `pstex'
         `pslatex'
         `pdflatex'
               Generate a LaTeX (or TeX) file for labels, and eps/ps/pdf
               for graphics.  The file produced by `epslatexstandalone'
               can be processed directly by LaTeX.  The other formats
               are intended to be included in a LaTeX (or TeX)
               document.  The `tex' device is the same as the
               `epslatex' device.  The `pdflatex' device is only
               available for the FLTK graphics toolkit.

         `tikz'
               Generate a LaTeX file using PGF/TikZ.  For the FLTK the
               result is   PGF.

         `ill'
         `aifm'
               Adobe Illustrator (Obsolete for Gnuplot versions > 4.2)

         `cdr'

         `emf'
         `meta'
               Microsoft Enhanced Metafile

         `fig'
               XFig.  For the Gnuplot graphics toolkit, the additional
               options `-textspecial' or `-textnormal' can be used to
               control     whether the special flag should be set for
               the text in     the figure (default is `-textnormal').

         `hpgl'
               HP plotter language

         `mf'
               Metafont

         `png'
               Portable network graphics

         `jpg'
         `jpeg'
               JPEG image

         `gif'
               GIF image (only available for the Gnuplot graphics
               toolkit)

         `pbm'
               PBMplus

         `svg'
               Scalable vector graphics

         `pdf'
               Portable document format

          If the device is omitted, it is inferred from the file
          extension, or if there is no filename it is sent to the
          printer as postscript.

    `-dGHOSTSCRIPT_DEVICE'
          Additional devices are supported by Ghostscript.  Some
          examples are;

         `ljet2p'
               HP LaserJet IIP

         `ljet3'
               HP LaserJet III

         `deskjet'
               HP DeskJet and DeskJet Plus

         `cdj550'
               HP DeskJet 550C

         `paintjet'
               HP PointJet

         `pcx24b'
               24-bit color PCX file format

         `ppm'
               Portable Pixel Map file format

         `pdfwrite'
               Produces pdf output from eps

          For a complete list, type `system ("gs -h")' to see what
          formats and devices are available.

          When Ghostscript output is sent to a printer the size is
          determined by the figure's "papersize" property.  When the
          output is sent to a file the size is determined by the plot
          box defined by the figure's "paperposition" property.

    `-append'
          Appends the PS, or PDF output to a pre-existing file of the
          same type.

    `-rNUM'
          Resolution of bitmaps in pixels per inch.  For both metafiles
          and SVG the default is the screen resolution, for other it is
          150 dpi.  To specify screen resolution, use "-r0".

    `-tight'
          Forces a tight bounding box for eps-files.

    `-PREVIEW'
          Adds a preview to eps-files.  Supported formats are;

         `-interchange'
               Provides an interchange preview.

         `-metalfile'
               Provides a metafile preview.

         `-pict'
               Provides pict preview.

         `-tiff'
               Provides a tiff preview.

    `-SXSIZE,YSIZE'
          Plot size in pixels for EMF, GIF, JPEG, PBM, PNG and SVG.  For
          PS, EPS, PDF, and other vector formats the plot size is in
          points.  This option is equivalent to changing the size of
          the plot box associated with "paperposition" property.  Using
          the command form of the print function, you must quote the
          XSIZE,YSIZE option.  For example, by writing `"-S640,480"'.

    `-FFONTNAME'
    `-FFONTNAME:SIZE'
    `-F:SIZE'
          Associates all text with the FONTNAME and/or FONTSIZE.
          FONTNAME is ignored for some devices; dxf, fig, hpgl, etc.

     The filename and options can be given in any order.

     Example: Print to a file, using the svg device.

          figure (1);
          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print -dsvg figure1.svg

     Example: Print to an HP Deskjet 550C.

          figure (1);
          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print -dcdj550

15.2.10 Interacting with Plots
------------------------------

The user can select points on a plot with the `ginput' function or
selection the position at which to place text on the plot with the
`gtext' function using the mouse.  Menus may also be created and
populated with specific user commands via the `uimenu' function.

 -- Function File: [X, Y, BUTTONS] = ginput (N)
     Return which mouse buttons were pressed and keys were hit on the
     current figure.  If N is defined, then wait for N mouse clicks
     before returning.  If N is not defined, then `ginput' will loop
     until the return key <RET> is pressed.

 -- Function File: B = waitforbuttonpress ()
     Wait for button or mouse press.over a figure window.  The value of
     B returns 0 if a mouse button was pressed or 1 is a key was
     pressed.

     *See also:* *note ginput: doc-ginput.

 -- Function File:  gtext (S)
 -- Function File:  gtext ({S1; S2; ...})
 -- Function File:  gtext (..., PROP, VAL)
     Place text on the current figure using the mouse.  The text is
     defined by the string S.  If S is a cell array, each element of
     the cell array is written to a separate line.  Additional
     arguments are passed to the underlying text object as properties.

     *See also:* *note ginput: doc-ginput, *note text: doc-text.

 -- Function File:  uimenu (PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- Function File:  uimenu (H, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
     Create a uimenu object and return a handle to it.  If H is ommited
     then a top-level menu for the current figure is created.  If H is
     given then a submenu relative to H is created.

     uimenu objects have the following specific properties:

    "accelerator"
          A string containing the key combination together with CTRL to
          execute this menu entry (e.g., "x" for CTRL+x).

    "callback"
          Is the function called when this menu entry is executed.  It
          can be either a function string (e.g., "myfun"), a function
          handle (e.g., @myfun) or a cell array containing the function
          handle and arguments for the callback function (e.g.,
          {@myfun, arg1, arg2}).

    "checked"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  Sets a mark at this menu entry.

    "enable"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If disabled the menu entry cannot
          be selected and it is grayed out.

    "foregroundcolor"
          A color value setting the text color for this menu entry.

    "label"
          A string containing the label for this menu entry.  A
          "&"-symbol can be used to mark the "accelerator" character
          (e.g., "E&xit")

    "position"
          An scalar value containing the relative menu position.  The
          entry with the lowest value is at the first position starting
          from left or top.

    "separator"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If enabled it draws a separator
          line above the current position.  It is ignored for top level
          entries.


     Examples:

          f = uimenu ("label", "&File", "accelerator", "f");
          e = uimenu ("label", "&Edit", "accelerator", "e");
          uimenu (f, "label", "Close", "accelerator", "q", ...
                     "callback", "close (gcf)");
          uimenu (e, "label", "Toggle &Grid", "accelerator", "g", ...
                     "callback", "grid (gca)");

15.2.11 Test Plotting Functions
-------------------------------

The functions `sombrero' and `peaks' provide a way to check that
plotting is working.  Typing either `sombrero' or `peaks' at the Octave
prompt should display a three-dimensional plot.

 -- Function File:  sombrero (N)
     Produce the familiar three-dimensional sombrero plot using N grid
     lines.  If N is omitted, a value of 41 is assumed.

     The function plotted is

          z = sin (sqrt (x^2 + y^2)) / (sqrt (x^2 + y^2))

     *See also:* *note surf: doc-surf, *note meshgrid: doc-meshgrid,

 -- Function File:  peaks ()
 -- Function File:  peaks (N)
 -- Function File:  peaks (X, Y)
 -- Function File: Z = peaks (...)
 -- Function File: [X, Y, Z] = peaks (...)
     Generate a function with lots of local maxima and minima.  The
     function has the form

     f(x,y) = 3*(1-x)^2*exp(-x^2 - (y+1)^2) ...
              - 10*(x/5 - x^3 - y^5)*exp(-x^2-y^2) ...
              - 1/3*exp(-(x+1)^2 - y^2)

     Called without a return argument, `peaks' plots the surface of the
     above function using `mesh'.  If N is a scalar, the `peaks'
     returns the values of the above function on a N-by-N mesh over the
     range `[-3,3]'.  The default value for N is 49.

     If N is a vector, then it represents the X and Y values of the
     grid on which to calculate the above function.  The X and Y values
     can be specified separately.

File: octave.info,  Node: Introduction to Graphics Structures,  Next: Graphics Objects,  Up: Graphics Data Structures

15.3.1 Introduction to Graphics Structures
------------------------------------------

The graphics functions use pointers, which are of class
graphics_handle, in order to address the data structures which control
graphical displays.  A graphics handle may point any one of a number of
different object types.  The objects are the graphics data structures.
The types of objects are: `figure', `axes', `line', `text', `patch',
`surface', `text' and `image'.

   Each of these objects has a function by the same name. and, each of
these functions returns a graphics handle pointing to an object of
corresponding type.  In addition there are several functions which
operate on properties of the graphics objects and which return handles:
the functions ` plot' and `plot3' return a handle pointing to an object
of type line, the function `subplot' returns a handle pointing to an
object of type axes, the function `fill' returns a handle pointing to
an object of type patch, the functions `area', `bar', `barh', `contour',
`contourf', `contour3', `surf', `mesh', `surfc', `meshc', `errorbar',
`quiver', `quiver3', `scatter', `scatter3', `stair', `stem', `stem3'
each return a handle as documented in *note Data Sources:
doc-datasources.

   The graphics objects are arranged in a hierarchy:

   1. The root is at 0.  i.e., `get (0)' returns the properties of the
root    object.

   2. Below the root are `figure' objects.

   3. Below the `figure' objects are `axes'.

   4. Below the `axes' objects are `line', `text', `patch', `surface',
and `image' objects.

   Graphics handles may be distinguished from function handles (*note
Function Handles::) by means of the function `ishandle'.  `ishandle'
returns true if its argument is a handle of a graphics object.  In
addition, the figure object may be tested using `isfigure'.  `isfigure'
returns true only if its argument is a handle of a figure. ishghandle()
is synonymous with ishandle().  The `whos' function can be used to show
the object type of each currently defined graphics handle.  (Note: this
is not true today, but it is, I hope, considered an error in whos.  It
may be better to have whos just show graphics_handle as the class, and
provide a new function which, given a graphics handle, returns its
object type.  This could generalize the ishandle() functions and, in
fact, replace them.)

   The `get' and `set' commands are used to obtain and set the values
of properties of graphics objects.  In addition, the `get' command may
be used to obtain property names.

   For example, the property "type" of the graphics object pointed to
by the graphics handle h may be displayed by:

     get (h, "type")

   The properties and their current values are returned by `get (h)'
where h is a handle of a graphics object.  If only the names of the
allowed properties are wanted they may be displayed by: `get (h, "")'.

   Thus, for example,

     h = figure ();
     get (h, "type")
     ans = figure
     get (h, "");
     error: get: ambiguous figure property name ; possible matches:

15.3.2 Graphics Objects
-----------------------

The hierarchy of graphics objects was explained above.  (See *note
Introduction to Graphics Structures::.  Here the specific objects are
described, and the properties contained in these objects are discussed.
Keep in mind that graphics objects are always referenced by "handle".

root figure
     the top level of the hierarchy and the parent of all figure
     objects.  The `handle' index of the root figure is 0.

figure
     A figure window.

axes
     A set of axes.  This object is a child of a figure object and may
     be a parent of line, text, image, patch, or surface objects.

line
     A line in two or three dimensions.

text
     Text annotations.

image
     A bitmap image.

patch
     A filled polygon, currently limited to two dimensions.

surface
     A three-dimensional surface.

15.3.2.1 Handle Functions
.........................

To determine whether a variable is a graphics object index or a figure
index, use the functions `ishandle' and `isfigure'.

 -- Built-in Function:  ishandle (H)
     Return true if H is a graphics handle and false otherwise.  H may
     also be a matrix of handles in which case a logical array is
     returned that is true where the elements of H are graphics handles
     and false where they are not.

     *See also:* *note isfigure: doc-isfigure.

 -- Function File:  ishghandle (H)
     Return true if H is a graphics handle and false otherwise.

 -- Function File:  isfigure (H)
     Return true if H is a graphics handle that contains a figure
     object.

     *See also:* *note ishandle: doc-ishandle.

   The function `gcf' returns an index to the current figure object, or
creates one if none exists.  Similarly, `gca' returns the current axes
object, or creates one (and its parent figure object) if none exists.

 -- Function File:  gcf ()
     Return the current figure handle.  If a figure does not exist,
     create one and return its handle.  The handle may then be used to
     examine or set properties of the figure.  For example,

          fplot (@sin, [-10, 10]);
          fig = gcf ();
          set (fig, "visible", "off");

     plots a sine wave, finds the handle of the current figure, and then
     makes that figure invisible.  Setting the visible property of the
     figure to `"on"' will cause it to be displayed again.

     *See also:* *note get: doc-get, *note set: doc-set.

 -- Function File:  gca ()
     Return a handle to the current axis object.  If no axis object
     exists, create one and return its handle.  The handle may then be
     used to examine or set properties of the axes.  For example,

          ax = gca ();
          set (ax, "position", [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);

     creates an empty axes object, then changes its location and size in
     the figure window.

     *See also:* *note get: doc-get, *note set: doc-set.

   The `get' and `set' functions may be used to examine and set
properties for graphics objects.  For example,

     get (0)
         => ans =
            {
              type = root
              currentfigure = [](0x0)
              children = [](0x0)
              visible = on
              ...
            }

returns a structure containing all the properties of the root figure.
As with all functions in Octave, the structure is returned by value, so
modifying it will not modify the internal root figure plot object.  To
do that, you must use the `set' function.  Also, note that in this
case, the `currentfigure' property is empty, which indicates that there
is no current figure window.

   The `get' function may also be used to find the value of a single
property.  For example,

     get (gca (), "xlim")
         => [ 0 1 ]

returns the range of the x-axis for the current axes object in the
current figure.

   To set graphics object properties, use the set function.  For
example,

     set (gca (), "xlim", [-10, 10]);

sets the range of the x-axis for the current axes object in the current
figure to `[-10, 10]'.  Additionally, calling set with a graphics
object index as the only argument returns a structure containing the
default values for all the properties for the given object type.  For
example,

     set (gca ())

returns a structure containing the default property values for axes
objects.

 -- Built-in Function:  get (H, P)
     Return the named property P from the graphics handle H.  If P is
     omitted, return the complete property list for H.  If H is a
     vector, return a cell array including the property values or lists
     respectively.

 -- Built-in Function:  set (H, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  set (H, PROPERTIES, VALUES)
 -- Built-in Function:  set (H, PV)
     Set named property values for the graphics handle (or vector of
     graphics handles) H.  There are three ways how to give the
     property names and values:

        * as a comma separated list of PROPERTY, VALUE pairs

          Here, each PROPERTY is a string containing the property name,
          each VALUE is a value of the appropriate type for the
          property.

        * as a cell array of strings PROPERTIES containing property
          names and a cell array VALUES containing property values.

          In this case, the number of columns of VALUES must match the
          number of elements in PROPERTIES.  The first column of VALUES
          contains values for the first entry in PROPERTIES, etc.  The
          number of rows of VALUES must be 1 or match the number of
          elements of H.  In the first case, each handle in H will be
          assigned the same values.  In the latter case, the first
          handle in H will be assigned the values from the first row of
          VALUES and so on.

        * as a structure array PV

          Here, the field names of PV represent the property names, and
          the field values give the property values.  In contrast to
          the previous case, all elements of PV will be set in all
          handles in H independent of the dimensions of PV.

 -- Function File: PARENT = ancestor (H, TYPE)
 -- Function File: PARENT = ancestor (H, TYPE, "toplevel")
     Return the first ancestor of handle object H whose type matches
     TYPE, where TYPE is a character string.  If TYPE is a cell array
     of strings, return the first parent whose type matches any of the
     given type strings.

     If the handle object H is of type TYPE, return H.

     If `"toplevel"' is given as a 3rd argument, return the highest
     parent in the object hierarchy that matches the condition, instead
     of the first (nearest) one.

     *See also:* *note get: doc-get, *note set: doc-set.

 -- Function File: H = allchild (HANDLES)
     Find all children, including hidden children, of a graphics object.

     This function is similar to `get (h, "children")', but also
     returns hidden objects.  If HANDLES is a scalar, H will be a
     vector.  Otherwise, H will be a cell matrix of the same size as
     HANDLES and each cell will contain a vector of handles.

     *See also:* *note get: doc-get, *note set: doc-set, *note findall:
     doc-findall, *note findobj: doc-findobj.

 -- Function File:  findfigs ()
     Find all visible figures that are currently off the screen and
     move them onto the screen.

15.3.4 Searching Properties
---------------------------

 -- Function File: H = findobj ()
 -- Function File: H = findobj (PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)
 -- Function File: H = findobj ("-property", PROP_NAME)
 -- Function File: H = findobj ("-regexp", PROP_NAME, PATTERN)
 -- Function File: H = findobj ("flat", ...)
 -- Function File: H = findobj (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = findobj (H, "-depth", D, ...)
     Find graphics object with specified property values.  The simplest
     form is

          findobj (PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     which returns all of the handles to the objects with the name
     PROP_NAME and the name PROP_VALUE.  The search can be limited to a
     particular object or set of objects and their descendants by
     passing a handle or set of handles H as the first argument to
     `findobj'.

     The depth of hierarchy of objects to which to search to can be
     limited with the "-depth" argument.  To limit the number depth of
     the hierarchy to search to D generations of children, and example
     is

          findobj (H, "-depth", D, PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     Specifying a depth D of 0, limits the search to the set of object
     passed in H.  A depth D of 0 is equivalent to the "-flat" argument.

     A specified logical operator may be applied to the pairs of
     PROP_NAME and PROP_VALUE.  The supported logical operators are
     "-and", "-or", "-xor", "-not".

     The objects may also be matched by comparing a regular expression
     to the property values, where property values that match `regexp
     (PROP_VALUE, PATTERN)' are returned.  Finally, objects may be
     matched by property name only, using the "-property" option.

     *See also:* *note get: doc-get, *note set: doc-set.

 -- Function File: H = findall ()
 -- Function File: H = findall (PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)
 -- Function File: H = findall (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = findall (H, "-depth", D, ...)
     Find graphics object with specified property values including
     hidden handles.

     This function performs the same function as `findobj', but it
     includes hidden objects in its search.  For full documentation, see
     `findobj'.

File: octave.info,  Node: Managing Default Properties,  Prev: Searching Properties,  Up: Graphics Data Structures

15.3.5 Managing Default Properties
----------------------------------

Object properties have two classes of default values, "factory
defaults" (the initial values) and "user-defined defaults", which may
override the factory defaults.

   Although default values may be set for any object, they are set in
parent objects and apply to child objects, of the specified object type.
For example, setting the default `color' property of `line' objects to
"green", for the `root' object, will result in all `line' objects
inheriting the `color' "green" as the default value.

     set (0, "defaultlinecolor", "green");

sets the default line color for all objects.  The rule for constructing
the property name to set a default value is

     default + OBJECT-TYPE + PROPERTY-NAME

   This rule can lead to some strange looking names, for example
`defaultlinelinewidth"' specifies the default `linewidth' property for
`line' objects.

   The example above used the root figure object, 0, so the default
property value will apply to all line objects.  However, default values
are hierarchical, so defaults set in a figure objects override those
set in the root figure object.  Likewise, defaults set in axes objects
override those set in figure or root figure objects.  For example,

     subplot (2, 1, 1);
     set (0, "defaultlinecolor", "red");
     set (1, "defaultlinecolor", "green");
     set (gca (), "defaultlinecolor", "blue");
     line (1:10, rand (1, 10));
     subplot (2, 1, 2);
     line (1:10, rand (1, 10));
     figure (2)
     line (1:10, rand (1, 10));

produces two figures.  The line in first subplot window of the first
figure is blue because it inherits its color from its parent axes
object.  The line in the second subplot window of the first figure is
green because it inherits its color from its parent figure object.  The
line in the second figure window is red because it inherits its color
from the global root figure parent object.

   To remove a user-defined default setting, set the default property to
the value `"remove"'.  For example,

     set (gca (), "defaultlinecolor", "remove");

removes the user-defined default line color setting from the current
axes object.  To quickly remove all user-defined defaults use the
`reset' function.

 -- Built-in Function:  reset (H, PROPERTY)
     Remove any defaults set for the handle H.  The default figure
     properties of "position", "units", "windowstyle" and "paperunits"
     and the default axes properties of "position" and "units" are not
     reset.

   Getting the `"default"' property of an object returns a list of
user-defined defaults set for the object.  For example,

     get (gca (), "default");

returns a list of user-defined default values for the current axes
object.

   Factory default values are stored in the root figure object.  The
command

     get (0, "factory");

returns a list of factory defaults.

    `"-."'
          A dash-dot line.

    `"none"'
          No line.  Points will still be marked using the current
          Marker Style.

`linewidth'
     A number specifying the width of the line.  The default is 1.  A
     value of 2 is twice as wide as the default, etc.

15.4.3 Marker Styles
--------------------

Marker styles are specified by the following properties:
`marker'
     A character indicating a plot marker to be place at each data
     point, or `"none"', meaning no markers should be displayed.

`markeredgecolor'
     The color of the edge around the marker, or `"auto"', meaning that
     the edge color is the same as the face color.  *Note Colors::.

`markerfacecolor'
     The color of the marker, or `"none"' to indicate that the marker
     should not be filled.  *Note Colors::.

`markersize'
     A number specifying the size of the marker.  The default is 1.  A
     value of 2 is twice as large as the default, etc.

   The `colstyle' function will parse a `plot'-style specification and
will return the color, line, and marker values that would result.

 -- Function File: [STYLE, COLOR, MARKER, MSG] = colstyle (LINESPEC)
     Parse LINESPEC and return the line style, color, and markers given.
     In the case of an error, the string MSG will return the text of the
     error.

15.4.4 Callbacks
----------------

Callback functions can be associated with graphics objects and triggered
after certain events occur.  The basic structure of all callback
function is

     function mycallback (src, data)
     ...
     endfunction

where `src' gives a handle to the source of the callback, and `code'
gives some event specific data.  This can then be associated with an
object either at the objects creation or later with the `set' function.
For example,

     plot (x, "DeleteFcn", @(s, e) disp("Window Deleted"))

where at the moment that the plot is deleted, the message "Window
Deleted" will be displayed.

   Additional user arguments can be passed to callback functions, and
will be passed after the 2 default arguments.  For example:

     plot (x, "DeleteFcn", {@mycallback, "1"})
     ...
     function mycallback (src, data, a1)
       fprintf ("Closing plot %d\n", a1);
     endfunction

   The basic callback functions that are available for all graphics
objects are

   * CreateFcn This is the callback that is called at the moment of the
     objects creation.  It is not called if the object is altered in
     any way, and so it only makes sense to define this callback in the
     function call that defines the object.  Callbacks that are added
     to `CreateFcn' later with the `set' function will never be
     executed.

   * DeleteFcn This is the callback that is called at the moment an
     object is deleted.

   * ButtonDownFcn This is the callback that is called if a mouse
     button is pressed while the pointer is over this object.  Note,
     that the gnuplot interface does not respect this callback.

   The object and figure that the event occurred in that resulted in the
callback being called can be found with the `gcbo' and `gcbf' functions.

 -- Function File: H = gcbo ()
 -- Function File: [H, FIG] = gcbo ()
     Return a handle to the object whose callback is currently
     executing.  If no callback is executing, this function returns the
     empty matrix.  This handle is obtained from the root object
     property "CallbackObject".

     Additionally return the handle of the figure containing the object
     whose callback is currently executing.  If no callback is
     executing, the second output is also set to the empty matrix.

     *See also:* *note gcf: doc-gcf, *note gca: doc-gca, *note gcbf:
     doc-gcbf.

 -- Function File: FIG = gcbf ()
     Return a handle to the figure containing the object whose callback
     is currently executing.  If no callback is executing, this function
     returns the empty matrix.  The handle returned by this function is
     the same as the second output argument of gcbo.

     *See also:* *note gcf: doc-gcf, *note gca: doc-gca, *note gcbo:
     doc-gcbo.

   Callbacks can equally be added to properties with the `addlistener'
function described below.

15.4.5 Application-defined Data
-------------------------------

Octave has a provision for attaching application-defined data to a
graphics handle.  The data can be anything which is meaningful to the
application, and will be completely ignored by Octave.

 -- Function File:  setappdata (H, NAME, VALUE)
     Set the named application data to VALUE for the object(s) with
     handle(s) H.  If the application data with the specified name does
     not exist, it is created.

 -- Function File: VALUE = getappdata (H, NAME)
     Return the VALUE for named application data for the object(s) with
     handle(s) H.

 -- Function File: APPDATA = getappdata (H)
     Return a structure, APPDATA, whose fields correspond to the appdata
     properties.

 -- Function File:  rmappdata (H, NAME)
     Delete the named application data for the object(s) with handle(s)
     H.

 -- Function File: V = isappdata (H, NAME)
     Return true if the named application data, NAME, exists for the
     object with handle H.

     doc-setappdata, *note rmappdata: doc-rmappdata.


File: octave.info,  Node: Object Groups,  Next: Graphics Toolkits,  Prev: Application-defined Data,  Up: Advanced Plotting

15.4.6 Object Groups
--------------------

A number of Octave high level plot functions return groups of other
graphics objects or they return graphics objects that have their
properties linked in such a way that changes to one of the properties
results in changes in the others.  A graphic object that groups other
objects is an `hggroup'

 -- Function File:  hggroup ()
 -- Function File:  hggroup (H)
 -- Function File:  hggroup (..., PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)
     Create group object with parent H.  If no parent is specified, the
     group is created in the current axes.  Return the handle of the
     group object created.

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified for the group, but
     they must appear in pairs.

   For example a simple use of a `hggroup' might be

     x = 0:0.1:10;
     hg = hggroup ();
     plot (x, sin (x), "color", [1, 0, 0], "parent", hg);
     hold on
     plot (x, cos (x), "color", [0, 1, 0], "parent", hg);
     set (hg, "visible", "off");

which groups the two plots into a single object and controls their
visibility directly.  The default properties of an `hggroup' are the
same as the set of common properties for the other graphics objects.
Additional properties can be added with the `addproperty' function.

 -- Built-in Function:  addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE)
 -- Built-in Function:  addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE, ARG, ...)
     Create a new property named NAME in graphics object H.  TYPE
     determines the type of the property to create.  ARGS usually
     contains the default value of the property, but additional
     arguments might be given, depending on the type of the property.

     The supported property types are:

    `string'
          A string property.  ARG contains the default string value.

    `any'
          An un-typed property.  This kind of property can hold any
          octave value.  ARGS contains the default value.

    `radio'
          A string property with a limited set of accepted values.  The
          first argument must be a string with all accepted values
          separated by a vertical bar ('|').  The default value can be
          marked by enclosing it with a '{' '}' pair.  The default
          value may also be given as an optional second string argument.

    `boolean'
          A boolean property.  This property type is equivalent to a
          radio property with "on|off" as accepted values.  ARG contains
          the default property value.

    `double'
          A scalar double property.  ARG contains the default value.

    `handle'
          A handle property.  This kind of property holds the handle of
          a graphics object.  ARG contains the default handle value.
          When no default value is given, the property is initialized to
          the empty matrix.

    `data'
          A data (matrix) property.  ARG contains the default data
          value.  When no default value is given, the data is
          initialized to the empty matrix.

    `color'
          A color property.  ARG contains the default color value.
          When no default color is given, the property is set to black.
          An optional second string argument may be given to specify an
          additional set of accepted string values (like a radio
          property).

     TYPE may also be the concatenation of a core object type and a
     valid property name for that object type.  The property created
     then has the same characteristics as the referenced property (type,
     possible values, hidden state...).  This allows to clone an
     existing property into the graphics object H.

     Examples:

          addproperty ("my_property", gcf, "string", "a string value");
          addproperty ("my_radio", gcf, "radio", "val_1|val_2|{val_3}");
          addproperty ("my_style", gcf, "linelinestyle", "--");


   Once a property in added to an `hggroup', it is not linked to any
other property of either the children of the group, or any other
graphics object.  Add so to control the way in which this newly added
property is used, the `addlistener' function is used to define a
callback function that is executed when the property is altered.

 -- Built-in Function:  addlistener (H, PROP, FCN)
     Register FCN as listener for the property PROP of the graphics
     object H.  Property listeners are executed (in order of
     registration) when the property is set.  The new value is already
     available when the listeners are executed.

     PROP must be a string naming a valid property in H.

     FCN can be a function handle, a string or a cell array whose first
     element is a function handle.  If FCN is a function handle, the
     corresponding function should accept at least 2 arguments, that
     will be set to the object handle and the empty matrix
     respectively.  If FCN is a string, it must be any valid octave
     expression.  If FCN is a cell array, the first element must be a
     function handle with the same signature as described above.  The
     next elements of the cell array are passed as additional arguments
     to the function.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
          endfunction

          addlistener (gcf, "position", {@my_listener, "my string"})


 -- Built-in Function:  dellistener (H, PROP, FCN)
     Remove the registration of FCN as a listener for the property PROP
     of the graphics object H.  The function FCN must be the same
     variable (not just the same value), as was passed to the original
     call to `addlistener'.

     If FCN is not defined then all listener functions of PROP are
     removed.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
          endfunction

          c = {@my_listener, "my string"};
          addlistener (gcf, "position", c);
          dellistener (gcf, "position", c);


   An example of the use of these two functions might be

     x = 0:0.1:10;
     hg = hggroup ();
     h = plot (x, sin (x), "color", [1, 0, 0], "parent", hg);
     addproperty ("linestyle", hg, "linelinestyle", get (h, "linestyle"));
     addlistener (hg, "linestyle", @update_props);
     hold on
     plot (x, cos (x), "color", [0, 1, 0], "parent", hg);

     function update_props (h, d)
       set (get (h, "children"), "linestyle", get (h, "linestyle"));
     endfunction

that adds a `linestyle' property to the `hggroup' and propagating any
changes its value to the children of the group.  The `linkprop'
function can be used to simplify the above to be

     x = 0:0.1:10;
     hg = hggroup ();
     h1 = plot (x, sin (x), "color", [1, 0, 0], "parent", hg);
     addproperty ("linestyle", hg, "linelinestyle", get (h, "linestyle"));
     hold on
     h2 = plot (x, cos (x), "color", [0, 1, 0], "parent", hg);
     hlink = linkprop ([hg, h1, h2], "color");

 -- Function File: HLINK = linkprop (H, PROP)
     Link graphics object properties, such that a change in one is
     propagated to the others.  The properties to link are given as a
     string of cell string array by PROP and the objects containing
     these properties by the handle array H.

     An example of the use of linkprop is

          x = 0:0.1:10;
          subplot (1,2,1);
          h1 = plot (x, sin (x));
          subplot (1,2,2);
          h2 = plot (x, cos (x));
          hlink = linkprop ([h1, h2], {"color","linestyle"});
          set (h1, "color", "green");
          set (h2, "linestyle", "--");


   These capabilities are used in a number of basic graphics objects.
The `hggroup' objects created by the functions of Octave contain one or
more graphics object and are used to:

   * group together multiple graphics objects,

   * create linked properties between different graphics objects, and

   * to hide the nominal user data, from the actual data of the objects.

For example the `stem' function creates a stem series where each
`hggroup' of the stem series contains two line objects representing the
body and head of the stem.  The `ydata' property of the `hggroup' of
the stem series represents the head of the stem, whereas the body of
the stem is between the baseline and this value.  For example

     h = stem (1:4)
     get (h, "xdata")
     => [  1   2   3   4]'
     get (get (h, "children")(1), "xdata")
     => [  1   1 NaN   2   2 NaN   3   3 NaN   4   4 NaN]'

shows the difference between the `xdata' of the `hggroup' of a stem
series object and the underlying line.

   The basic properties of such group objects is that they consist of
one or more linked `hggroup', and that changes in certain properties of
these groups are propagated to other members of the group.  Whereas,
certain properties of the members of the group only apply to the current
member.

   In addition the members of the group can also be linked to other
graphics objects through callback functions.  For example the baseline
of the `bar' or `stem' functions is a line object, whose length and
position are automatically adjusted, based on changes to the
corresponding hggroup elements.

15.4.6.1 Data Sources in Object Groups
......................................

All of the group objects contain data source parameters.  There are
string parameters that contain an expression that is evaluated to update
the relevant data property of the group when the `refreshdata' function
is called.

 -- Function File:  refreshdata ()
 -- Function File:  refreshdata (H)
 -- Function File:  refreshdata (H, WORKSPACE)
     Evaluate any `datasource' properties of the current figure and
     update the plot if the corresponding data has changed.  If called
     with one or more arguments H is a scalar or array of figure
     handles to refresh.  The optional second argument WORKSPACE can
     take the following values.

    "base"
          Evaluate the datasource properties in the base workspace.
          (default).

    "caller"
          Evaluate the datasource properties in the workspace of the
          function that called `refreshdata'.

     An example of the use of `refreshdata' is:

          x = 0:0.1:10;
          y = sin (x);
          plot (x, y, "ydatasource", "y");
          for i = 1 : 100
            pause (0.1);
            y = sin (x + 0.1*i);
            refreshdata ();

     The value where the base of the area plot is drawn.

`linewidth'
`linestyle'
     The line width and style of the edge of the patch objects making
     up the areas.  *Note Line Styles::.

15.4.6.3 Bar Series
...................

Bar series objects are created by the `bar' or `barh' functions.  Each
`hggroup' element contains a single patch object.  The properties of
the bar series are

`showbaseline'
`baseline'
`basevalue'
     The property `showbaseline' flags whether the baseline of the bar
     series is displayed (default is "on").  The handle of the graphics
     object representing the baseline is given by the `baseline'
     property and the y-value of the baseline by the `basevalue'
     property.

     Changes to any of these property are propagated to the other
     members of the bar series and to the baseline itself.  Equally
     changes in the properties of the base line itself are propagated
     to the members of the corresponding bar series.

`barwidth'
`barlayout'
`horizontal'
     The property `barwidth' is the width of the bar corresponding to
     the WIDTH variable passed to `bar' or BARH.  Whether the bar
     series is "grouped" or "stacked" is determined by the `barlayout'
     property and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical by the
     `horizontal' property.

     Changes to any of these property are propagated to the other
     members of the bar series.

`linewidth'
`linestyle'
     The line width and style of the edge of the patch objects making
     up the bars.  *Note Line Styles::.

`edgecolor'
`facecolor'
     The line and fill color of the patch objects making up the bars.
     *Note Colors::.

`xdata'
     The nominal x positions of the bars.  Changes in this property and
     propagated to the other members of the bar series.

`ydata'
     The y value of the bars in the `hggroup'.

`xdatasource'
`ydatasource'
     Data source variables.

15.4.6.4 Contour Groups
.......................

Contour group objects are created by the `contour', `contourf' and
`contour3' functions.  The are equally one of the handles returned by
the `surfc' and `meshc' functions.  The properties of the contour group
are

`contourmatrix'
     A read only property that contains the data return by `contourc'
     used to create the contours of the plot.

`fill'
     A radio property that can have the values "on" or "off" that flags
     whether the contours to plot are to be filled.

`zlevelmode'
`zlevel'
     The radio property `zlevelmode' can have the values "none", "auto"
     or "manual".  When its value is "none" there is no z component to
     the plotted contours.  When its value is "auto" the z value of the
     plotted contours is at the same value as the contour itself.  If
     the value is "manual", then the z value at which to plot the
     contour is determined by the `zlevel' property.

`levellistmode'
`levellist'
`levelstepmode'
`levelstep'
     If `levellistmode' is "manual", then the levels at which to plot
     the contours is determined by `levellist'.  If `levellistmode' is
     set to "auto", then the distance between contours is determined by
     `levelstep'.  If both `levellistmode' and `levelstepmode' are set
     to "auto", then there are assumed to be 10 equal spaced contours.

`textlistmode'
`textlist'
`textstepmode'
`textstep'
     If `textlistmode' is "manual", then the labeled contours is
     determined by `textlist'.  If `textlistmode' is set to "auto",
     then the distance between labeled contours is determined by
     `textstep'.  If both `textlistmode' and `textstepmode' are set to
     "auto", then there are assumed to be 10 equal spaced labeled
     contours.

`showtext'
     Flag whether the contour labels are shown or not.

`labelspacing'
     The distance between labels on a single contour in points.

`linewidth'

`linestyle'

`linecolor'
     The properties of the contour lines.  The properties `linewidth'
     and `linestyle' are similar to the corresponding properties for
     lines.  The property `linecolor' is a color property (*note
     Colors::), that can also have the values of "none" or "auto".  If
     `linecolor' is "none", then no contour line is drawn.  If
     `linecolor' is "auto" then the line color is determined by the
     colormap.

`xdata'
`ydata'
`zdata'
     The original x, y, and z data of the contour lines.

`xdatasource'
`ydatasource'
`zdatasource'
     Data source variables.

Quiver series objects are created by the `quiver' or `quiver3'
functions.  Each `hggroup' element of the series contains three line
objects as children representing the body and head of the arrow,
together with a marker as the point of origin of the arrows.  The
properties of the quiver series are

`autoscale'
`autoscalefactor'
     Flag whether the length of the arrows is scaled or defined
     directly from the U, V and W data.  If the arrow length is flagged

16 Matrix Manipulation
**********************

There are a number of functions available for checking to see if the
elements of a matrix meet some condition, and for rearranging the
elements of a matrix.  For example, Octave can easily tell you if all
the elements of a matrix are finite, or are less than some specified
value.  Octave can also rotate the elements, extract the upper- or
lower-triangular parts, or sort the columns of a matrix.

* Finding Elements and Checking Conditions::

* Famous Matrices::


File: octave.info,  Node: Finding Elements and Checking Conditions,  Next: Rearranging Matrices,  Up: Matrix Manipulation

16.1 Finding Elements and Checking Conditions
=============================================

The functions `any' and `all' are useful for determining whether any or
all of the elements of a matrix satisfy some condition.  The `find'
function is also useful in determining which elements of a matrix meet
a specified condition.

 -- Built-in Function:  any (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  any (X, DIM)
     For a vector argument, return true (logical 1) if any element of
     the vector is nonzero.

     For a matrix argument, return a row vector of logical ones and
     zeros with each element indicating whether any of the elements of
     the corresponding column of the matrix are nonzero.  For example:

          any (eye (2, 4))
           => [ 1, 1, 0, 0 ]

     If the optional argument DIM is supplied, work along dimension
     DIM.  For example:

          any (eye (2, 4), 2)
           => [ 1; 1 ]

     *See also:* *note all: doc-all.

 -- Built-in Function:  all (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  all (X, DIM)
     For a vector argument, return true (logical 1) if all elements of
     the vector are nonzero.

     For a matrix argument, return a row vector of logical ones and
     zeros with each element indicating whether all of the elements of
     the corresponding column of the matrix are nonzero.  For example:

          all ([2, 3; 1, 0]))
              => [ 1, 0 ]

     If the optional argument DIM is supplied, work along dimension DIM.

     *See also:* *note any: doc-any.

   Since the comparison operators (*note Comparison Ops::) return
matrices of ones and zeros, it is easy to test a matrix for many
things, not just whether the elements are nonzero.  For example,

     all (all (rand (5) < 0.9))
          => 0

tests a random 5 by 5 matrix to see if all of its elements are less
than 0.9.

   Note that in conditional contexts (like the test clause of `if' and
`while' statements) Octave treats the test as if you had typed `all
(all (condition))'.

 -- Mapping Function: Z = xor (X, Y)
     Return the `exclusive or' of the entries of X and Y.  For boolean
     expressions X and Y, `xor (X, Y)' is true if and only if one of X
     or Y is true.  Otherwise, for X and Y both true or both false,
     `xor' returns false.

     The truth table for the xor operation is

                                   X  Y   Z  
                                   0  0   0  
                                   1  0   1  
                                   0  1   1  
                                   1  1   0  

     *See also:* *note and: doc-and, *note or: doc-or, *note not:
     doc-not.

 -- Built-in Function:  diff (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  diff (X, K)
 -- Built-in Function:  diff (X, K, DIM)
     If X is a vector of length n, `diff (X)' is the vector of first
     differences  X(2) - X(1), ..., X(n) - X(n-1).

     If X is a matrix, `diff (X)' is the matrix of column differences
     along the first non-singleton dimension.

     The second argument is optional.  If supplied, `diff (X, K)',
     where K is a non-negative integer, returns the K-th differences.
     It is possible that K is larger than the first non-singleton
     dimension of the matrix.  In this case, `diff' continues to take
     the differences along the next non-singleton dimension.

     The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly
     stated with the optional variable DIM.  In this case the K-th
     order differences are calculated along this dimension.  In the
     case where K exceeds `size (X, DIM)' an empty matrix is returned.

 -- Mapping Function:  isinf (X)
     Return a logical array which is true where the elements of X are
     are infinite and false where they are not.  For example:

          isinf ([13, Inf, NA, NaN])
                => [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ]

     *See also:* *note isfinite: doc-isfinite, *note isnan: doc-isnan,
     *note isna: doc-isna.

 -- Mapping Function:  isnan (X)
     Return a logical array which is true where the elements of X are
     NaN values and false where they are not.  NA values are also
     considered NaN values.  For example:

          isnan ([13, Inf, NA, NaN])
                => [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ]

     *See also:* *note isna: doc-isna, *note isinf: doc-isinf, *note
     isfinite: doc-isfinite.

 -- Mapping Function:  isfinite (X)
 -- Mapping Function:  finite (X)
     Return a logical array which is true where the elements of X are
     finite values and false where they are not.  For example:

          finite ([13, Inf, NA, NaN])
               => [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ]

     *See also:* *note isinf: doc-isinf, *note isnan: doc-isnan, *note
     isna: doc-isna.

 -- Function File: [ERR, Y1, ...] = common_size (X1, ...)
     Determine if all input arguments are either scalar or of common
     size.  If so, ERR is zero, and YI is a matrix of the common size
     with all entries equal to XI if this is a scalar or XI otherwise.
     If the inputs cannot be brought to a common size, ERR is 1, and YI
     is XI.  For example:

          [errorcode, a, b] = common_size ([1 2; 3 4], 5)
               => errorcode = 0
               => a = [ 1, 2; 3, 4 ]
               => b = [ 5, 5; 5, 5 ]

     This is useful for implementing functions where arguments can
     either be scalars or of common size.

 -- Loadable Function: IDX = find (X)
 -- Loadable Function: IDX = find (X, N)
 -- Loadable Function: IDX = find (X, N, DIRECTION)
 -- Loadable Function: [i, j] = find (...)
 -- Loadable Function: [i, j, v] = find (...)
     Return a vector of indices of nonzero elements of a matrix, as a
     row if X is a row vector or as a column otherwise.  To obtain a
     single index for each matrix element, Octave pretends that the
     columns of a matrix form one long vector (like Fortran arrays are
     stored).  For example:

          find (eye (2))
            => [ 1; 4 ]

     If two outputs are requested, `find' returns the row and column
     indices of nonzero elements of a matrix.  For example:

          [i, j] = find (2 * eye (2))
              => i = [ 1; 2 ]
              => j = [ 1; 2 ]

     If three outputs are requested, `find' also returns a vector
     containing the nonzero values.  For example:

          [i, j, v] = find (3 * eye (2))
                 => i = [ 1; 2 ]
                 => j = [ 1; 2 ]
                 => v = [ 3; 3 ]

     If two inputs are given, N indicates the maximum number of
     elements to find from the beginning of the matrix or vector.

     If three inputs are given, DIRECTION should be one of "first" or
     "last", requesting only the first or last N indices, respectively.
     However, the indices are always returned in ascending order.

     Note that this function is particularly useful for sparse
     matrices, as it extracts the non-zero elements as vectors, which
     can then be used to create the original matrix.  For example:

          sz = size (a);
          [i, j, v] = find (a);
          b = sparse (i, j, v, sz(1), sz(2));

     *See also:* *note nonzeros: doc-nonzeros.

 -- Loadable Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y)
 -- Loadable Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y, OPT)
     Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to
     interpolation.

     If table is increasing and `idx = lookup (table, y)', then
     `table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))' for all `y(i)' within
     the table.  If `y(i) < table(1)' then `idx(i)' is 0. If `y(i) >=
     table(end)' or `isnan (y(i))' then `idx(i)' is `n'.

     If the table is decreasing, then the tests are reversed.  For
     non-strictly monotonic tables, empty intervals are always skipped.
     The result is undefined if TABLE is not monotonic, or if TABLE
     contains a NaN.

     The complexity of the lookup is O(M*log(N)) where N is the size of
     TABLE and M is the size of Y.  In the special case when Y is also
     sorted, the complexity is O(min(M*log(N),M+N)).

     TABLE and Y can also be cell arrays of strings (or Y can be a
     single string).  In this case, string lookup is performed using
     lexicographical comparison.

     If OPTS is specified, it must be a string with letters indicating
     additional options.

    `m'
          `table(idx(i)) == val(i)' if `val(i)' occurs in table;
          otherwise, `idx(i)' is zero.

    `b'
          `idx(i)' is a logical 1 or 0, indicating whether `val(i)' is
          contained in table or not.

    `l'
          For numeric lookups the leftmost subinterval shall be
          extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at least 1)

    `r'
          For numeric lookups the rightmost subinterval shall be
          extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at most n-1).

   If you wish to check if a variable exists at all, instead of
properties its elements may have, consult *note Status of Variables::.

16.2 Rearranging Matrices
=========================

 -- Function File:  fliplr (X)
     Return a copy of X with the order of the columns reversed.  In
     other words, X is flipped left-to-right about a vertical axis.  For
     example:

          fliplr ([1, 2; 3, 4])
               =>  2  1
                   4  3

     Note that `fliplr' only works with 2-D arrays.  To flip N-D arrays
     use `flipdim' instead.

     *note rot90: doc-rot90, *note rotdim: doc-rotdim.

 -- Function File:  flipud (X)
     Return a copy of X with the order of the rows reversed.  In other
     words, X is flipped upside-down about a horizontal axis.  For
     example:

          flipud ([1, 2; 3, 4])
               =>  3  4
                   1  2

     Note that `flipud' only works with 2-D arrays.  To flip N-D arrays
     use `flipdim' instead.

 -- Function File:  flipdim (X)
 -- Function File:  flipdim (X, DIM)
     Return a copy of X flipped about the dimension DIM.  DIM defaults
     to the first non-singleton dimension.  For example:

          flipdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], 2)
                =>  2  1
                    4  3

     *note rot90: doc-rot90, *note rotdim: doc-rotdim.

 -- Function File:  rot90 (A)
 -- Function File:  rot90 (A, K)
     Return a copy of A with the elements rotated counterclockwise in
     90-degree increments.  The second argument is optional, and
     specifies how many 90-degree rotations are to be applied (the
     default value is 1).  Negative values of K rotate the matrix in a
     clockwise direction.  For example,

          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
              =>  3  1
                  4  2

     rotates the given matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.  The following
     are all equivalent statements:

          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3)
          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 7)

     Note that `rot90' only works with 2-D arrays.  To rotate N-D arrays
     use `rotdim' instead.

 -- Function File:  rotdim (X)
 -- Function File:  rotdim (X, N)
 -- Function File:  rotdim (X, N, PLANE)
     Return a copy of X with the elements rotated counterclockwise in
     90-degree increments.  The second argument N is optional, and
     specifies how many 90-degree rotations are to be applied (the
     default value is 1).  The third argument is also optional and
     defines the plane of the rotation.  If present, PLANE is a two
     element vector containing two different valid dimensions of the
     matrix.  When PLANE is not given the first two non-singleton
     dimensions are used.

     Negative values of N rotate the matrix in a clockwise direction.
     For example,

          rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1, [1, 2])
               =>  3  1
                   4  2

     rotates the given matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.  The following
     are all equivalent statements:

          rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1, [1, 2])
          rotdim ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3, [1, 2])

 -- Built-in Function:  cat (DIM, ARRAY1, ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN)
     Return the concatenation of N-D array objects, ARRAY1, ARRAY2,
     ..., ARRAYN along dimension DIM.

          A = ones (2, 2);
          B = zeros (2, 2);
          cat (2, A, B)
            => 1 1 0 0
               1 1 0 0

     Alternatively, we can concatenate A and B along the second
     dimension in the following way:

          [A, B]

     DIM can be larger than the dimensions of the N-D array objects and
     the result will thus have DIM dimensions as the following example
     shows:

          cat (4, ones (2, 2), zeros (2, 2))
            => ans(:,:,1,1) =

                 1 1
                 1 1

               ans(:,:,1,2) =

                 0 0
                 0 0

     *See also:* *note horzcat: doc-horzcat, *note vertcat: doc-vertcat.

 -- Built-in Function:  horzcat (ARRAY1, ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN)
     Return the horizontal concatenation of N-D array objects, ARRAY1,
     ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN along dimension 2.

     Arrays may also be concatenated horizontally using the syntax for
     creating new matrices.  For example:

          HCAT = [ ARRAY1, ARRAY2, ... ]

     *See also:* *note cat: doc-cat, *note vertcat: doc-vertcat.

 -- Built-in Function:  vertcat (ARRAY1, ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN)
     Return the vertical concatenation of N-D array objects, ARRAY1,
     ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN along dimension 1.

     Arrays may also be concatenated vertically using the syntax for
     creating new matrices.  For example:

          VCAT = [ ARRAY1; ARRAY2; ... ]

     *See also:* *note cat: doc-cat, *note horzcat: doc-horzcat.

 -- Built-in Function:  permute (A, PERM)
     Return the generalized transpose for an N-D array object A.  The
     permutation vector PERM must contain the elements `1:ndims(A)' (in
     any order, but each element must appear only once).

     *See also:* *note ipermute: doc-ipermute.

 -- Built-in Function:  ipermute (A, IPERM)
     The inverse of the `permute' function.  The expression

          ipermute (permute (A, perm), perm)

     returns the original array A.

     *See also:* *note permute: doc-permute.

 -- Built-in Function:  reshape (A, M, N, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  reshape (A, [M N ...])
 -- Built-in Function:  reshape (A, ..., [], ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  reshape (A, SIZE)
     Return a matrix with the specified dimensions (M, N, ...)  whose
     elements are taken from the matrix A.  The elements of the matrix
     are accessed in column-major order (like Fortran arrays are
     stored).

     The following code demonstrates reshaping a 1x4 row vector into a
     2x2 square matrix.

          reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)
                =>  1  3
                    2  4

     Note that the total number of elements in the original matrix
     (`prod (size (A))') must match the total number of elements in the
     new matrix (`prod ([M N ...])').

     A single dimension of the return matrix may be left unspecified
     and Octave will determine its size automatically.  An empty matrix
     ([]) is used to flag the unspecified dimension.

     *See also:* *note resize: doc-resize.

 -- Built-in Function:  resize (X, M)
 -- Built-in Function:  resize (X, M, N, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  resize (X, [M N ...])
     Resize X cutting off elements as necessary.

     In the result, element with certain indices is equal to the
     corresponding element of X if the indices are within the bounds of
     X; otherwise, the element is set to zero.

     In other words, the statement

          y = resize (x, dv)

     is equivalent to the following code:

          y = zeros (dv, class (x));
          sz = min (dv, size (x));
          for i = 1:length (sz)
            idx{i} = 1:sz(i);
          endfor
          y(idx{:}) = x(idx{:});

     but is performed more efficiently.

     If only M is supplied, and it is a scalar, the dimension of the
     result is M-by-M.  If M, N, ... are all scalars, then the
     dimensions of the result are M-by-N-by-....  If given a vector as
     input, then the dimensions of the result are given by the elements
     of that vector.

     An object can be resized to more dimensions than it has; in such
     case the missing dimensions are assumed to be 1.  Resizing an
     object to fewer dimensions is not possible.

 -- Function File: Y = circshift (X, N)
     Circularly shift the values of the array X.  N must be a vector of
     integers no longer than the number of dimensions in X.  The values
     of N can be either positive or negative, which determines the
     direction in which the values or X are shifted.  If an element of
     N is zero, then the corresponding dimension of X will not be
     shifted.  For example:

          x = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
          circshift (x, 1)
          =>  7, 8, 9
              1, 2, 3
              4, 5, 6
          circshift (x, -2)
          =>  7, 8, 9
              1, 2, 3
              4, 5, 6
          circshift (x, [0,1])
          =>  3, 1, 2
              6, 4, 5
              9, 7, 8

     *See also:* permute, ipermute, shiftdim.

 -- Function File:  shift (X, B)
 -- Function File:  shift (X, B, DIM)
     If X is a vector, perform a circular shift of length B of the
     elements of X.

     If X is a matrix, do the same for each column of X.  If the
     optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

 -- Function File: Y = shiftdim (X, N)
 -- Function File: [Y, NS] = shiftdim (X)
     Shift the dimensions of X by N, where N must be an integer scalar.
     When N is positive, the dimensions of X are shifted to the left,
     with the leading dimensions circulated to the end.  If N is
     negative, then the dimensions of X are shifted to the right, with
     N leading singleton dimensions added.

     Called with a single argument, `shiftdim', removes the leading
     singleton dimensions, returning the number of dimensions removed
     in the second output argument NS.

     For example:

          x = ones (1, 2, 3);
          size (shiftdim (x, -1))
             => [1, 1, 2, 3]
          size (shiftdim (x, 1))
             => [2, 3]
          [b, ns] = shiftdim (x)
             => b = [1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1]
             => ns = 1

 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X, DIM)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X, MODE)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X, DIM, MODE)
     Return a copy of X with the elements arranged in increasing order.
     For matrices, `sort' orders the elements within columns

     For example:

          sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
             =>  1  1
                 2  2
                 3  3

     If the optional argument DIM is given, then the matrix is sorted
     along the dimension defined by DIM.  The optional argument `mode'
     defines the order in which the values will be sorted.  Valid
     values of `mode' are "ascend" or "descend".

     The `sort' function may also be used to produce a matrix
     containing the original row indices of the elements in the sorted
     matrix.  For example:

          [s, i] = sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
            => s = 1  1
                   2  2
                   3  3
            => i = 1  3
                   2  1
                   3  2

     For equal elements, the indices are such that equal elements are
     listed in the order in which they appeared in the original list.

     Sorting of complex entries is done first by magnitude (`abs (Z)')
     and for any ties by phase angle (`angle (z)').  For example:

          sort ([1+i; 1; 1-i])
              => 1 + 0i
                 1 - 1i
                 1 + 1i

     NaN values are treated as being greater than any other value and
     are sorted to the end of the list.

     The `sort' function may also be used to sort strings and cell
     arrays of strings, in which case ASCII dictionary order (uppercase
     'A' precedes lowercase 'a') of the strings is used.

     The algorithm used in `sort' is optimized for the sorting of
     partially ordered lists.

 -- Function File: [S, I] = sortrows (A)
 -- Function File: [S, I] = sortrows (A, C)
     Sort the rows of the matrix A according to the order of the
     columns specified in C.  If C is omitted, a lexicographical sort
     is used.  By default ascending order is used however if elements
     of C are negative then the corresponding column is sorted in
     descending order.

     *See also:* *note sort: doc-sort.

 -- Built-in Function:  issorted (A)
 -- Built-in Function:  issorted (A, MODE)
 -- Built-in Function:  issorted (A, "rows", MODE)
     Return true if the array is sorted according to MODE, which may be
     either "ascending", "descending", or "either".  By default,  MODE
     is "ascending".  NaNs are treated in the same manner as `sort'.

     If the optional argument "rows" is supplied, check whether the
     array is sorted by rows as output by the function `sortrows' (with
     no options).

     This function does not support sparse matrices.

     *See also:* *note sort: doc-sort, *note sortrows: doc-sortrows.

 -- Built-in Function:  nth_element (X, N)
 -- Built-in Function:  nth_element (X, N, DIM)
     Select the n-th smallest element of a vector, using the ordering
     defined by `sort'.  In other words, the result is equivalent to
     `sort(X)(N)'.  N can also be a contiguous range, either ascending
     `l:u' or descending `u:-1:l', in which case a range of elements is
     returned.  If X is an array, `nth_element' operates along the
     dimension defined by DIM, or the first non-singleton dimension if
     DIM is not given.

     nth_element encapsulates the C++ standard library algorithms
     nth_element and partial_sort.  On average, the complexity of the
     operation is O(M*log(K)), where `M = size (X, DIM)' and
     `K = length (N)'.  This function is intended for cases where the
     ratio K/M is small; otherwise, it may be better to use `sort'.

     doc-max.

 -- Function File:  tril (A)
 -- Function File:  tril (A, K)
 -- Function File:  tril (A, K, PACK)
 -- Function File:  triu (A)
 -- Function File:  triu (A, K)
 -- Function File:  triu (A, K, PACK)
     Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower (`tril') or
     upper (`triu') triangular part of the matrix A, and setting all
     other elements to zero.  The second argument is optional, and
     specifies how many diagonals above or below the main diagonal
     should also be set to zero.

     The default value of K is zero, so that `triu' and `tril' normally
     include the main diagonal as part of the result.

     If the value of K is negative, additional elements above (for
     `tril') or below (for `triu') the main diagonal are also selected.

     The absolute value of K must not be greater than the number of
     sub-diagonals or super-diagonals.

     For example:

          tril (ones (3), -1)
               =>  0  0  0
                   1  0  0
                   1  1  0

     and

          tril (ones (3), 1)
               =>  1  1  0
                   1  1  1
                   1  1  1

     If the option "pack" is given as third argument, the extracted
     elements are not inserted into a matrix, but rather stacked
     column-wise one above other.

     *See also:* *note diag: doc-diag.

 -- Built-in Function: V = vec (X)
 -- Built-in Function: V = vec (X, DIM)
     Return the vector obtained by stacking the columns of the matrix X
     one above the other.  Without DIM this is equivalent to `X(:)'.
     If DIM is supplied, the dimensions of V are set to DIM with all
     elements along the last dimension.  This is equivalent to
     `shiftdim (X(:), 1-DIM)'.

     *See also:* *note vech: doc-vech.

 -- Function File:  vech (X)
     Return the vector obtained by eliminating all supradiagonal
     elements of the square matrix X and stacking the result one column
     above the other.  This has uses in matrix calculus where the
     underlying matrix is symmetric and it would be pointless to keep
     values above the main diagonal.

 -- Function File:  prepad (X, L)
 -- Function File:  prepad (X, L, C)
 -- Function File:  prepad (X, L, C, DIM)
     Prepend the scalar value C to the vector X until it is of length
     L.  If C is not given, a value of 0 is used.

     If `length (X) > L', elements from the beginning of X are removed
     until a vector of length L is obtained.

     If X is a matrix, elements are prepended or removed from each row.

     If the optional argument DIM is given, operate along this
     dimension.

 -- Function File:  postpad (X, L)
 -- Function File:  postpad (X, L, C)
 -- Function File:  postpad (X, L, C, DIM)
     Append the scalar value C to the vector X until it is of length L.
     If C is not given, a value of 0 is used.

     If `length (X) > L', elements from the end of X are removed until
     a vector of length L is obtained.

     If X is a matrix, elements are appended or removed from each row.

     If the optional argument DIM is given, operate along this
     dimension.

 -- Built-in Function: M = diag (V)
 -- Built-in Function: M = diag (V, K)
 -- Built-in Function: M = diag (V, M, N)
 -- Built-in Function: V = diag (M)
 -- Built-in Function: V = diag (M, K)
     Return a diagonal matrix with vector V on diagonal K.  The second
     argument is optional.  If it is positive, the vector is placed on
     the K-th super-diagonal.  If it is negative, it is placed on the
     -K-th sub-diagonal.  The default value of K is 0, and the vector
     is placed on the main diagonal.  For example:

          diag ([1, 2, 3], 1)
             =>  0  1  0  0
                 0  0  2  0
                 0  0  0  3
                 0  0  0  0

     The 3-input form returns a diagonal matrix with vector V on the
     main diagonal and the resulting matrix being of size M rows x N
     columns.

     Given a matrix argument, instead of a vector, `diag' extracts the
     K-th diagonal of the matrix.

 -- Function File:  blkdiag (A, B, C, ...)
     Build a block diagonal matrix from A, B, C, ...  All the arguments
     must be numeric and are two-dimensional matrices or scalars.  If

16.3 Special Utility Matrices
=============================

 -- Built-in Function:  eye (N)
 -- Built-in Function:  eye (M, N)
 -- Built-in Function:  eye ([M N])
 -- Built-in Function:  eye (..., CLASS)
     Return an identity matrix.  If invoked with a single scalar
     argument N, return a square NxN identity matrix.  If supplied two
     scalar arguments (M, N), `eye' takes them to be the number of rows
     and columns.  If given a vector with two elements, `eye' uses the
     values of the elements as the number of rows and columns,
     respectively.  For example:

          eye (3)
           =>  1  0  0
               0  1  0
               0  0  1

     The following expressions all produce the same result:

          eye (2)
          ==
          eye (2, 2)
          ==
          eye (size ([1, 2; 3, 4])

     The optional argument CLASS, allows `eye' to return an array of
     the specified type, like

          val = zeros (n,m, "uint8")

     Calling `eye' with no arguments is equivalent to calling it with
     an argument of 1.  Any negative dimensions are treated as zero.
     These odd definitions are for compatibility with MATLAB.

 -- Built-in Function:  ones (N)
 -- Built-in Function:  ones (M, N)
 -- Built-in Function:  ones (M, N, K, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  ones ([M N ...])
 -- Built-in Function:  ones (..., CLASS)
     Return a matrix or N-dimensional array whose elements are all 1.
     If invoked with a single scalar integer argument N, return a square
     NxN matrix.  If invoked with two or more scalar integer arguments,
     or a vector of integer values, return an array with the given
     dimensions.

     If you need to create a matrix whose values are all the same, you
     should use an expression like

          val_matrix = val * ones (m, n)

     The optional argument CLASS specifies the class of the return array
     and defaults to double.  For example:

          val = ones (m,n, "uint8")

     *See also:* *note zeros: doc-zeros.

 -- Built-in Function:  zeros (N)
 -- Built-in Function:  zeros (M, N)
 -- Built-in Function:  zeros (M, N, K, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  zeros ([M N ...])
 -- Built-in Function:  zeros (..., CLASS)
     Return a matrix or N-dimensional array whose elements are all 0.
     If invoked with a single scalar integer argument, return a square
     NxN matrix.  If invoked with two or more scalar integer arguments,
     or a vector of integer values, return an array with the given
     dimensions.

     The optional argument CLASS specifies the class of the return array
     and defaults to double.  For example:

          val = zeros (m,n, "uint8")

 -- Function File:  repmat (A, M)
 -- Function File:  repmat (A, M, N)
 -- Function File:  repmat (A, [M N])
 -- Function File:  repmat (A, [M N P ...])
     Form a block matrix of size M by N, with a copy of matrix A as
     each element.  If N is not specified, form an M by M block matrix.
     For copying along more than two dimensions, specify the number of
     times to copy across each dimension M, N, P, ..., in a vector in
     the second argument.

     *See also:* *note repelems: doc-repelems.

 -- Built-in Function:  repelems (X, R)
     Construct a vector of repeated elements from X.  R is a 2xN
     integer matrix specifying which elements to repeat and how often
     to repeat each element.

     Entries in the first row, R(1,j), select an element to repeat.
     The corresponding entry in the second row, R(2,j), specifies the
     repeat count.  If X is a matrix then the columns of X are imagined
     to be stacked on top of each other for purposes of the selection
     index.  A row vector is always returned.

     Conceptually the result is calculated as follows:

          y = [];
          for i = 1:columns (R)
            y = [y, X(R(1,i)*ones(1, R(2,i)))];
          endfor

   The functions `linspace' and `logspace' make it very easy to create
vectors with evenly or logarithmically spaced elements.  *Note Ranges::.

 -- Built-in Function:  linspace (BASE, LIMIT)
 -- Built-in Function:  linspace (BASE, LIMIT, N)
     Return a row vector with N linearly spaced elements between BASE
     and LIMIT.  If the number of elements is greater than one, then
     the endpoints BASE and LIMIT are always included in the range.  If
     BASE is greater than LIMIT, the elements are stored in decreasing
     order.  If the number of points is not specified, a value of 100
     is used.

     The `linspace' function always returns a row vector if both BASE
     and LIMIT are scalars.  If one, or both, of them are column
     vectors, `linspace' returns a matrix.

     For compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument (LIMIT)
     if fewer than two values are requested.

 -- Function File:  logspace (A, B)
 -- Function File:  logspace (A, B, N)
 -- Function File:  logspace (A, pi, N)
     Return a row vector with N elements logarithmically spaced from
     10^A to 10^B.  If N is unspecified it defaults to 50.

     If B is equal to pi, the points are between 10^A and pi, _not_
     10^A and 10^pi, in order to be compatible with the corresponding
     MATLAB function.

     Also for compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument B
     if fewer than two values are requested.

     Return a matrix with random elements uniformly distributed on the
     interval (0, 1).  The arguments are handled the same as the
     arguments for `eye'.

     You can query the state of the random number generator using the
     form

          v = rand ("state")

     This returns a column vector V of length 625.  Later, you can
     restore the random number generator to the state V using the form

          rand ("state", v)

     You may also initialize the state vector from an arbitrary vector
     of length <= 625 for V.  This new state will be a hash based on the
     value of V, not V itself.

     By default, the generator is initialized from `/dev/urandom' if it
     is available, otherwise from CPU time, wall clock time, and the
     current fraction of a second.  Note that this differs from MATLAB,
     which always initializes the state to the same state at startup.
     To obtain behavior comparable to MATLAB, initialize with a
     deterministic state vector in Octave's startup files (*note
     Startup Files::).

     To compute the pseudo-random sequence, `rand' uses the Mersenne
     Twister with a period of 2^19937-1 (See M. Matsumoto and T.
     Nishimura, `Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed
     uniform pseudorandom number generator', ACM Trans. on Modeling and
     Computer Simulation Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 3-30, January 1998,
     `http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html').  Do
     *not* use for cryptography without securely hashing several
     returned values together, otherwise the generator state can be
     learned after reading 624 consecutive values.

     Older versions of Octave used a different random number generator.
     The new generator is used by default as it is significantly faster
     than the old generator, and produces random numbers with a
     significantly longer cycle time.  However, in some circumstances
     it might be desirable to obtain the same random sequences as used
     by the old generators.  To do this the keyword "seed" is used to
     specify that the old generators should be use, as in

          rand ("seed", val)

     which sets the seed of the generator to VAL.  The seed of the
     generator can be queried with

          s = rand ("seed")

     However, it should be noted that querying the seed will not cause
     `rand' to use the old generators, only setting the seed will.  To
     cause `rand' to once again use the new generators, the keyword
     "state" should be used to reset the state of the `rand'.

     The state or seed of the generator can be reset to a new random
     value using the "reset" keyword.

     The class of the value returned can be controlled by a trailing
     "double" or "single" argument. These are the only valid classes.

     Return random integers in the range 1:IMAX.

     Additional arguments determine the shape of the return matrix.
     When no arguments are specified a single random integer is
     returned.  If one argument N is specified then a square matrix
     (N x N) is returned.  Two or more arguments will return a
     multi-dimensional matrix (M x N x ...).

     The integer range may optionally be described by a two element
     matrix with a lower and upper bound in which case the returned
     integers will be on the interval [IMIN, IMAX].

     The optional argument "CLASS" will return a matrix of the requested
     type.  The default is "double".

     The following example returns 150 integers in the range 1-10.

          ri = randi (10, 150, 1)

     Implementation Note: `randi' relies internally on `rand' which
     uses class "double" to represent numbers.  This limits the maximum
     integer (IMAX) and range (IMAX - IMIN) to the value returned by
     the `bitmax' function.  For IEEE floating point numbers this value
     is 2^53 - 1.

   The generators operate in the new or old style together, it is not
possible to mix the two.  Initializing any generator with `"state"' or
`"seed"' causes the others to switch to the same style for future calls.

   The state of each generator is independent and calls to different
generators can be interleaved without affecting the final result.  For
example,

     rand ("state", [11, 22, 33]);
     randn ("state", [44, 55, 66]);
     u = rand (100, 1);
     n = randn (100, 1);

and

     rand ("state", [11, 22, 33]);
     randn ("state", [44, 55, 66]);
     u = zeros (100, 1);
     n = zeros (100, 1);
     for i = 1:100
       u(i) = rand ();
       n(i) = randn ();
     end

produce equivalent results.  When the generators are initialized in the
old style with `"seed"' only `rand' and `randn' are independent,
because the old `rande', `randg' and `randp' generators make calls to
`rand' and `randn'.

   The generators are initialized with random states at start-up, so
that the sequences of random numbers are not the same each time you run
Octave.(1) If you really do need to reproduce a sequence of numbers
exactly, you can set the state or seed to a specific value.

   If invoked without arguments, `rand' and `randn' return a single
element of a random sequence.

   The original `rand' and `randn' functions use Fortran code from
RANLIB, a library of Fortran routines for random number generation,
compiled by Barry W. Brown and James Lovato of the Department of
Biomathematics at The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX 77030.

 -- Loadable Function:  randperm (N)
 -- Loadable Function:  randperm (N, M)
     Return a row vector containing a random permutation of `1:N'.  If
     M is supplied, return M unique entries, sampled without
     replacement from `1:N'.  The complexity is O(N) in memory and O(M)
     in time, unless M < N/5, in which case O(M) memory is used as
     well.  The randomization is performed using rand(). All
     permutations are equally likely.

16.4 Famous Matrices
====================

The following functions return famous matrix forms.

 -- Function File:  hadamard (N)
     Construct a Hadamard matrix (Hn) of size N-by-N.  The size N must
     be of the form 2^k * p in which p is one of 1, 12, 20 or 28.  The
     returned matrix is normalized, meaning `Hn(:,1) == 1' and
     `Hn(1,:) == 1'.

     Some of the properties of Hadamard matrices are:

        * `kron (Hm, Hn)' is a Hadamard matrix of size M-by-N.

        * `Hn * Hn' = N * eye (N)'.

        * The rows of Hn are orthogonal.

        * `det (A) <= abs (det (Hn))' for all A with
          `abs (A(i, j)) <= 1'.

        * Multiplying any row or column by -1 and the matrix will
          remain a Hadamard matrix.

     *See also:* *note compan: doc-compan, *note hankel: doc-hankel,
     *note toeplitz: doc-toeplitz.

 -- Function File:  hankel (C)
 -- Function File:  hankel (C, R)
     Return the Hankel matrix constructed from the first column C, and
     (optionally) the last row R.  If the last element of C is not the
     same as the first element of R, the last element of C is used.  If
     the second argument is omitted, it is assumed to be a vector of
     zeros with the same size as C.

     A Hankel matrix formed from an m-vector C, and an n-vector R, has
     the elements

          H(i,j) = c(i+j-1),  i+j-1 <= m;
          H(i,j) = r(i+j-m),  otherwise

     *See also:* *note hadamard: doc-hadamard, *note toeplitz:
     doc-toeplitz.

 -- Function File:  hilb (N)
     Return the Hilbert matrix of order N.  The i,j element of a
     Hilbert matrix is defined as

          H(i, j) = 1 / (i + j - 1)

     Hilbert matrices are close to being singular which make them
     difficult to invert with numerical routines.  Comparing the
     condition number of a random matrix 5x5 matrix with that of a
     Hilbert matrix of order 5 reveals just how difficult the problem
     is.

          cond (rand (5))
             => 14.392
          cond (hilb (5))
             => 4.7661e+05

     *See also:* *note invhilb: doc-invhilb.

 -- Function File:  invhilb (N)
     Return the inverse of the Hilbert matrix of order N.  This can be
     computed exactly using


                      (i+j)         /n+i-1\  /n+j-1\   /i+j-2\ 2
           A(i,j) = -1      (i+j-1)(       )(       ) (       )
                                    \ n-j /  \ n-i /   \ i-2 /

                  = p(i) p(j) / (i+j-1)

     where

                       k  /k+n-1\   /n\
              p(k) = -1  (       ) (   )
                          \ k-1 /   \k/

     The validity of this formula can easily be checked by expanding
     the binomial coefficients in both formulas as factorials.  It can
     be derived more directly via the theory of Cauchy matrices.  See
     J. W. Demmel, `Applied Numerical Linear Algebra', p. 92.

     Compare this with the numerical calculation of `inverse (hilb
     (n))', which suffers from the ill-conditioning of the Hilbert
     matrix, and the finite precision of your computer's floating point
     arithmetic.

     *See also:* *note hilb: doc-hilb.

 -- Function File:  magic (N)
     Create an N-by-N magic square.  A magic square is an arrangement
     of the integers `1:n^2' such that the row sums, column sums, and
     diagonal sums are all equal to the same value.

     Note: N must be greater than 2 for the magic square to exist.

 -- Function File:  pascal (N)
 -- Function File:  pascal (N, T)
     Return the Pascal matrix of order N if `T = 0'.  T defaults to 0.
     Return the pseudo-lower triangular Cholesky factor of the Pascal
     matrix if `T = 1' (The sign of some columns may be negative).
     This matrix is its own inverse, that is `pascal (N, 1) ^ 2 == eye
     (N)'.  If `T = -1', return the true Cholesky factor with strictly
     positive values on the diagonal.  If `T = 2', return a transposed
     and permuted version of `pascal (N, 1)', which is the cube root of
     the identity matrix.  That is, `pascal (N, 2) ^ 3 == eye (N)'.

     *See also:* *note chol: doc-chol.

 -- Function File:  rosser ()
     Return the Rosser matrix.  This is a difficult test case used to
     evaluate eigenvalue algorithms.

     *See also:* *note wilkinson: doc-wilkinson, *note eig: doc-eig.

 -- Function File:  toeplitz (C)
 -- Function File:  toeplitz (C, R)
     Return the Toeplitz matrix constructed from the first column C,
     and (optionally) the first row R.  If the first element of R is
     not the same as the first element of C, the first element of C is
     used.  If the second argument is omitted, the first row is taken
     to be the same as the first column.

     A square Toeplitz matrix has the form:

          c(0)  r(1)   r(2)  ...  r(n)
          c(1)  c(0)   r(1)  ... r(n-1)

          c(n) c(n-1) c(n-2) ...  c(0)

     *See also:* *note hankel: doc-hankel.

 -- Function File:  vander (C)
 -- Function File:  vander (C, N)
     Return the Vandermonde matrix whose next to last column is C.  If
     N is specified, it determines the number of columns; otherwise, N
     is taken to be equal to the length of C.

     A Vandermonde matrix has the form:

          c(1)^(n-1) ... c(1)^2  c(1)  1
          c(2)^(n-1) ... c(2)^2  c(2)  1

 -- Function File:  wilkinson (N)
     Return the Wilkinson matrix of order N.  Wilkinson matrices are
     symmetric and tridiagonal with pairs of nearly, but not exactly,
     equal eigenvalues.  They are useful in testing the behavior and
     performance of eigenvalue solvers.

17.3 Trigonometry
=================

Octave provides the following trigonometric functions where angles are
specified in radians.  To convert from degrees to radians multiply by
`pi/180' (e.g., `sin (30 * pi/180)' returns the sine of 30 degrees).  As
an alternative, Octave provides a number of trigonometric functions
which work directly on an argument specified in degrees.  These
functions are named after the base trigonometric function with a `d'
suffix.  For example, `sin' expects an angle in radians while `sind'
expects an angle in degrees.

17.4 Sums and Products
======================

 -- Built-in Function:  sum (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (X, DIM)
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (..., "native")
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (..., "double")
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (..., "extra")
     Sum of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is omitted, it
     defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     If the optional argument "native" is given, then the sum is
     performed in the same type as the original argument, rather than
     in the default double type.  For example:

          sum ([true, true])
             => 2
          sum ([true, true], "native")
             => true

     On the contrary, if "double" is given, the sum is performed in
     double precision even for single precision inputs.

     For double precision inputs, "extra" indicates that a more accurate
     algorithm than straightforward summation is to be used.  For
     single precision inputs, "extra" is the same as "double".
     Otherwise, "extra" has no effect.

     *note prod: doc-prod.

 -- Built-in Function:  prod (X)

 -- Built-in Function:  cumsum (X, DIM)
 -- Built-in Function:  cumsum (..., "native")
 -- Built-in Function:  cumsum (..., "double")
 -- Built-in Function:  cumsum (..., "extra")
     Cumulative sum of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is
     omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     See `sum' for an explanation of the optional parameters "native",
     "double", and "extra".

     *See also:* *note sum: doc-sum, *note cumprod: doc-cumprod.

 -- Built-in Function:  cumprod (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  cumprod (X, DIM)
     Cumulative product of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is

     *See also:* *note prod: doc-prod, *note cumsum: doc-cumsum.

 -- Built-in Function:  sumsq (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  sumsq (X, DIM)
     Sum of squares of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is
     omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     This function is conceptually equivalent to computing

          sum (x .* conj (x), dim)

     but it uses less memory and avoids calling `conj' if X is real.

 -- Loadable Function:  max (X, Y)
 -- Loadable Function:  max (X, [], DIM)

     For a vector argument, return the maximum value.  For a matrix
     argument, return the maximum value from each column, as a row
     vector, or over the dimension DIM if defined, in which case Y
     should be set to the empty matrix (it's ignored otherwise).  For
     two matrices (or a matrix and scalar), return the pair-wise
     maximum.  Thus,

          max (max (X))

     returns the largest element of the matrix X, and

          max (2:5, pi)
              =>  3.1416  3.1416  4.0000  5.0000

     compares each element of the range `2:5' with `pi', and returns a
     row vector of the maximum values.

     For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for
     comparison.

     If called with one input and two output arguments, `max' also
     returns the first index of the maximum value(s).  Thus,

          [x, ix] = max ([1, 3, 5, 2, 5])
              =>  x = 5
                  ix = 3

 -- Loadable Function:  min (X, Y, DIM)
 -- Loadable Function: [W, IW] = min (X)
     For a vector argument, return the minimum value.  For a matrix
     argument, return the minimum value from each column, as a row
     vector, or over the dimension DIM if defined, in which case Y
     should be set to the empty matrix (it's ignored otherwise).  For
     two matrices (or a matrix and scalar), return the pair-wise
     minimum.  Thus,

          min (min (X))

     returns the smallest element of X, and

              =>  2.0000  3.0000  3.1416  3.1416

     compares each element of the range `2:5' with `pi', and returns a
     row vector of the minimum values.

     For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for
     comparison.

     If called with one input and two output arguments, `min' also
     returns the first index of the minimum value(s).  Thus,

          [x, ix] = min ([1, 3, 0, 2, 0])
              =>  x = 0

 -- Loadable Function:  cummax (X)

 -- Loadable Function: [W, IW] = cummax (X)
     Return the cumulative maximum values along dimension DIM.  If DIM
     is unspecified it defaults to column-wise operation.  For example:

          cummax ([1 3 2 6 4 5])
             =>  1  3  3  6  6  6

     The call

          [w, iw] = cummax (x, dim)

     with `x' a vector, is equivalent to the following code:

          w = iw = zeros (size (x));
          for i = 1:length (x)
            [w(i), iw(i)] = max (x(1:i));

          cummin ([5 4 6 2 3 1])
             =>  5  4  4  2  2  1

     The call

 -- Built-in Function:  hypot (X, Y)
 -- Built-in Function:  hypot (X, Y, Z, ...)
     Compute the element-by-element square root of the sum of the

     but calculated in a manner that avoids overflows for large values
     of X or Y.  `hypot' can also be called with more than 2 arguments;
     in this case, the arguments are accumulated from left to right:

          hypot (hypot (X, Y), Z)
          hypot (hypot (hypot (X, Y), Z), W), etc.

 -- Function File: DX = gradient (M)
 -- Function File: [DX, DY, DZ, ...] = gradient (M)
 -- Function File: [...] = gradient (M, S)
 -- Function File: [...] = gradient (M, X, Y, Z, ...)
 -- Function File: [...] = gradient (F, X0)
 -- Function File: [...] = gradient (F, X0, S)
 -- Function File: [...] = gradient (F, X0, X, Y, ...)
     Calculate the gradient of sampled data or a function.  If M is a
     vector, calculate the one-dimensional gradient of M.  If M is a
     matrix the gradient is calculated for each dimension.

     `[DX, DY] = gradient (M)' calculates the one dimensional gradient
     for X and Y direction if M is a matrix.  Additional return
     arguments can be use for multi-dimensional matrices.

     A constant spacing between two points can be provided by the S
     parameter.  If S is a scalar, it is assumed to be the spacing for
     all dimensions.  Otherwise, separate values of the spacing can be
     supplied by the X, ... arguments.  Scalar values specify an
     equidistant spacing.  Vector values for the X, ... arguments
     specify the coordinate for that dimension.  The length must match
     their respective dimension of M.

     At boundary points a linear extrapolation is applied.  Interior
     points are calculated with the first approximation of the
     numerical gradient

          y'(i) = 1/(x(i+1)-x(i-1)) * (y(i-1)-y(i+1)).

     If the first argument F is a function handle, the gradient of the
     function at the points in X0 is approximated using central
     difference.  For example, `gradient (@cos, 0)' approximates the
     gradient of the cosine function in the point x0 = 0.  As with
     sampled data, the spacing values between the points from which the
     gradient is estimated can be set via the S or DX, DY, ...
     arguments.  By default a spacing of 1 is used.

 -- Loadable Function:  dot (X, Y, DIM)
     Compute the dot product of two vectors.  If X and Y are matrices,
     calculate the dot products along the first non-singleton
     dimension.  If the optional argument DIM is given, calculate the
     dot products along this dimension.

     This is equivalent to `sum (conj (X) .* Y, DIM)', but avoids
     forming a temporary array and is faster.  When X and Y are column
     vectors, the result is equivalent to `X' * Y'.

               => [ 1; -1; 1 ]

     If X and Y are matrices, the cross product is applied along the
     first dimension with 3 elements.  The optional argument DIM forces
     the cross product to be calculated along the specified dimension.

     of the angular velocity vector in direction of the z-axis for

 -- Function File: D = del2 (M)
 -- Function File: D = del2 (M, H)
 -- Function File: D = del2 (M, DX, DY, ...)
     Calculate the discrete Laplace operator.  For a 2-dimensional
     matrix M this is defined as

                1    / d^2            d^2         \
          D  = --- * | ---  M(x,y) +  ---  M(x,y) |
                4    \ dx^2           dy^2        /

     For N-dimensional arrays the sum in parentheses is expanded to
     include second derivatives over the additional higher dimensions.

     The spacing between evaluation points may be defined by H, which
     is a scalar defining the equidistant spacing in all dimensions.
     Alternatively, the spacing in each dimension may be defined
     separately by DX, DY, etc.  A scalar spacing argument defines
     equidistant spacing, whereas a vector argument can be used to
     specify variable spacing.  The length of the spacing vectors must
     match the respective dimension of M.  The default spacing value is
     1.

     At least 3 data points are needed for each dimension.  Boundary
     points are calculated from the linear extrapolation of interior
     points.

 -- Function File:  factorial (N)
     Return the factorial of N where N is a positive integer.  If N is

     With two output arguments, return the unique primes P and their
     multiplicities.  That is, `prod (P .^ N) == Q'.

 -- Loadable Function: G = gcd (A1, A2, ...)
 -- Loadable Function: [G, V1, ...] = gcd (A1, A2, ...)
     Compute the greatest common divisor of A1, A2, ....  If more than
     one argument is given all arguments must be the same size or
     scalar.  In this case the greatest common divisor is calculated
     for each element individually.  All elements must be ordinary or
     Gaussian (complex) integers.  Note that for Gaussian integers, the
     gcd is not unique up to units (multiplication by 1, -1, I or -I),
     so an arbitrary greatest common divisor amongst four possible is
     returned.

     Example code:

          gcd ([15, 9], [20, 18])
             =>  5  9

     Optional return arguments V1, etc., contain integer vectors such

     Return the remainder of the division `X / Y', computed using the

     An error message is printed if the dimensions of the arguments do
     not agree, or if either of the arguments is complex.

     *See also:* *note mod: doc-mod.

 -- Mapping Function:  mod (X, Y)
     Compute the modulo of X and Y.  Conceptually this is given by

          x - y .* floor (x ./ y)

     and is written such that the correct modulus is returned for
     integer types.  This function handles negative values correctly.
     That is, `mod (-1, 3)' is 2, not -1, as `rem (-1, 3)' returns.
     `mod (X, 0)' returns X.

     An error results if the dimensions of the arguments do not agree,
     or if either of the arguments is complex.

 -- Function File:  primes (N)
     Return all primes up to N.

     The algorithm used is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

     Note that if you need a specific number of primes you can use the
     fact that the distance from one prime to the next is, on average,
     proportional to the logarithm of the prime.  Integrating, one finds
     that there are about k primes less than k*log(5*k).

          sign (x) =  0, x = 0;
                      1, x > 0.

     For complex arguments, `sign' returns `x ./ abs (X)'.

     Compute Bessel or Hankel functions of various kinds:

    `besselj'
          Bessel functions of the first kind.  If the argument OPT is
          supplied, the result is multiplied by `exp(-abs(imag(X)))'.

    `bessely'
          Bessel functions of the second kind.  If the argument OPT is
          supplied, the result is multiplied by `exp(-abs(imag(X)))'.

    `besseli'
          Modified Bessel functions of the first kind.  If the argument
          OPT is supplied, the result is multiplied by

          multiplied by `exp (-I*X)' for K = 1 or `exp (I*X)' for K = 2.

     If ALPHA is a scalar, the result is the same size as X.  If X is a
     scalar, the result is the same size as ALPHA.  If ALPHA is a row
     vector and X is a column vector, the result is a matrix with
     `length (X)' rows and `length (ALPHA)' columns.  Otherwise, ALPHA
     and X must conform and the result will be the same size.

     The value of ALPHA must be real.  The value of X may be complex.

     If A is scalar, then `gammainc (X, A)' is returned for each
     element of X and vice versa.

     If neither X nor A is scalar, the sizes of X and A must agree, and
     `gammainc' is applied element-by-element.

     By default the incomplete gamma function integrated from 0 to X is
     computed.  If "upper" is given then the complementary function
     integrated from X to infinity is calculated.  It should be noted
     that

          gammainc (X, A) == 1 - gammainc (X, A, "upper")

     If the optional argument `normalization' is `"sch"', compute the
     Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre function.  The Schmidt
     semi-normalized associated Legendre function is related to the
     unnormalized Legendre functions by the following:

     For Legendre functions of degree n and order 0:

            0      0
          SP(x) = P(x)
            n      n

     For Legendre functions of degree n and order m:

     If the optional argument NORMALIZATION is `"norm"', compute the
     fully normalized associated Legendre function.  The fully
     normalized associated Legendre function is related to the
     unnormalized Legendre functions by the following:

     For Legendre functions of degree N and order M

            m      m         m    (n+0.5)(n-m)! 0.5

============================

 -- Function File: S = rat (X, TOL)
 -- Function File: [N, D] = rat (X, TOL)
     Find a rational approximation to X within the tolerance defined by
     TOL using a continued fraction expansion.  For example:

          rat (pi) = 3 + 1/(7 + 1/16) = 355/113
          rat (e) = 3 + 1/(-4 + 1/(2 + 1/(5 + 1/(-2 + 1/(-7)))))
                  = 1457/536

     Called with two arguments returns the numerator and denominator
     separately as two matrices.

     *See also:* *note rats: doc-rats.

 -- Built-in Function:  rats (X, LEN)
     Convert X into a rational approximation represented as a string.
     You can convert the string back into a matrix as follows:

          r = rats (hilb (4));
          x = str2num (r)

     The optional second argument defines the maximum length of the
     string representing the elements of X.  By default LEN is 9.

18.1 Techniques Used for Linear Algebra
=======================================

Octave includes a polymorphic solver, that selects an appropriate
matrix factorization depending on the properties of the matrix itself.
Generally, the cost of determining the matrix type is small relative to
the cost of factorizing the matrix itself, but in any case the matrix
type is cached once it is calculated, so that it is not re-determined
each time it is used in a linear equation.

   The selection tree for how the linear equation is solve or a matrix
inverse is form is given by

  1. If the matrix is upper or lower triangular sparse a forward or
     backward substitution using the LAPACK xTRTRS function, and goto 4.

  2. If the matrix is square, Hermitian with a real positive diagonal,
     attempt Cholesky factorization using the LAPACK xPOTRF function.

  3. If the Cholesky factorization failed or the matrix is not
     Hermitian with a real positive diagonal, and the matrix is square,
     factorize using the LAPACK xGETRF function.

  4. If the matrix is not square, or any of the previous solvers flags
     a singular or near singular matrix, find a least squares solution
     using the LAPACK xGELSD function.

   The user can force the type of the matrix with the `matrix_type'
function.  This overcomes the cost of discovering the type of the
matrix.  However, it should be noted that identifying the type of the
matrix incorrectly will lead to unpredictable results, and so
`matrix_type' should be used with care.

   It should be noted that the test for whether a matrix is a candidate
for Cholesky factorization, performed above and by the `matrix_type'
function, does not give a certainty that the matrix is Hermitian.
However, the attempt to factorize the matrix will quickly flag a
non-Hermitian matrix.

18.2 Basic Matrix Functions
===========================

 -- Loadable Function: AA = balance (A)
 -- Loadable Function: AA = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [DD, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [D, P, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [CC, DD, AA, BB] = balance (A, B, OPT)
     Compute `AA = DD \ A * DD' in which AA is a matrix whose row and
     column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and `DD = P * D', in
     which P is a permutation matrix and D is a diagonal matrix of
     powers of two.  This allows the equilibration to be computed
     without round-off.  Results of eigenvalue calculation are
     typically improved by balancing first.

     If two output values are requested, `balance' returns the diagonal
     D and the permutation P separately as vectors.  In this case, `DD
     = eye(n)(:,P) * diag (D)', where n is the matrix size.

     If four output values are requested, compute `AA = CC*A*DD' and
     `BB = CC*B*DD', in which AA and BB have non-zero elements of
     approximately the same magnitude and CC and DD are permuted
     diagonal matrices as in DD for the algebraic eigenvalue problem.

     The eigenvalue balancing option OPT may be one of:

    "noperm", "S"
          Scale only; do not permute.

    "noscal", "P"
          Permute only; do not scale.

     Algebraic eigenvalue balancing uses standard LAPACK routines.

     Generalized eigenvalue problem balancing uses Ward's algorithm
     (SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 1981).

 -- Function File:  cond (A)
 -- Function File:  cond (A, P)
     Compute the P-norm condition number of a matrix.

     `cond (A)' is ## defined as `norm (A, P) * norm (inv (A), P)'.

     By default `P = 2' is used which implies a (relatively slow)
     singular value decomposition.  Other possible selections are `P =
     1, Inf, "fro"' which are generally faster.  See `norm' for a full
     discussion of possible P values.

 -- Loadable Function:  det (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [D, RCOND] = det (A)
     Compute the determinant of A.

     Return an estimate of the reciprocal condition number if requested.

     Routines from LAPACK are used for full matrices and code from
     UMFPACK is used for sparse matrices.

     The determinant should not be used to check a matrix for
     singularity.  For that, use any of the condition number functions:
     `cond', `condest', `rcond'.

     *See also:* *note cond: doc-cond, *note condest: doc-condest,
     *note rcond: doc-rcond.

 -- Loadable Function: LAMBDA = eig (A)
 -- Loadable Function: LAMBDA = eig (A, B)
 -- Loadable Function: [V, LAMBDA] = eig (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [V, LAMBDA] = eig (A, B)
     Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

     Eigenvalues are computed in a several step process which begins
     with a Hessenberg decomposition, followed by a
     Schur decomposition, from which the eigenvalues are apparent.  The
     eigenvectors, when desired, are computed by further manipulations
     of the Schur decomposition.

     The eigenvalues returned by `eig' are not ordered.

     *See also:* *note eigs: doc-eigs, *note svd: doc-svd.

 -- Loadable Function: G = givens (X, Y)
 -- Loadable Function: [C, S] = givens (X, Y)
     Return a 2 by 2 orthogonal matrix `G = [C S; -S' C]' such that `G
     [X; Y] = [*; 0]' with X and Y scalars.

     For example:

          givens (1, 1)
             =>   0.70711   0.70711
                 -0.70711   0.70711

 -- Function File: [G, Y] = planerot (X)
     Given a two-element column vector, returns the 2 by 2 orthogonal
     matrix G such that `Y = G * X' and `Y(2) = 0'.

     *See also:* *note givens: doc-givens.

 -- Loadable Function: X = inv (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [X, RCOND] = inv (A)
     Compute the inverse of the square matrix A.  Return an estimate of
     the reciprocal condition number if requested, otherwise warn of an
     ill-conditioned matrix if the reciprocal condition number is small.

     In general it is best to avoid calculating the inverse of a matrix
     directly.  For example, it is both faster and more accurate to
     solve systems of equations (A*x = b) with `Y = A \ b', rather than
     `Y = inv (A) * b'.

     If called with a sparse matrix, then in general X will be a full
     matrix requiring significantly more storage.  Avoid forming the
     inverse of a sparse matrix if possible.

 -- Loadable Function: TYPE = matrix_type (A)
 -- Loadable Function: TYPE = matrix_type (A, "nocompute")
 -- Loadable Function: A = matrix_type (A, TYPE)
 -- Loadable Function: A = matrix_type (A, "upper", PERM)
 -- Loadable Function: A = matrix_type (A, "lower", PERM)
 -- Loadable Function: A = matrix_type (A, "banded", NL, NU)
     Identify the matrix type or mark a matrix as a particular type.
     This allows more rapid solutions of linear equations involving A
     to be performed.  Called with a single argument, `matrix_type'
     returns the type of the matrix and caches it for future use.
     Called with more than one argument, `matrix_type' allows the type
     of the matrix to be defined.

     If the option "nocompute" is given, the function will not attempt
     to guess the type if it is still unknown.  This is useful for
     debugging purposes.

     The possible matrix types depend on whether the matrix is full or
     sparse, and can be one of the following

    "unknown"
          Remove any previously cached matrix type, and mark type as
          unknown.

    "full"
          Mark the matrix as full.

    "positive definite"
          Probable full positive definite matrix.

    "diagonal"
          Diagonal matrix.  (Sparse matrices only)

    "permuted diagonal"
          Permuted Diagonal matrix.  The permutation does not need to
          be specifically indicated, as the structure of the matrix
          explicitly gives this.  (Sparse matrices only)

    "upper"
          Upper triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is
          given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted upper
          triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

    "lower"
          Lower triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is
          given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted lower
          triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

    "banded"
    "banded positive definite"
          Banded matrix with the band size of NL below the diagonal and
          NU above it.  If NL and NU are 1, then the matrix is
          tridiagonal and treated with specialized code.  In addition
          the matrix can be marked as probably a positive definite.
          (Sparse matrices only)

    "singular"
          The matrix is assumed to be singular and will be treated with
          a minimum norm solution.


     Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the
     first attempt to solve a linear equation involving A.  Therefore
     `matrix_type' is only useful to give Octave hints of the matrix
     type.  Incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in
     incorrect results from solutions of linear equations; it is
     entirely *the responsibility of the user* to correctly identify
     the matrix type.

     Also, the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a
     Hermitian matrix with a real positive diagonal.  This does not
     guarantee that the matrix is positive definite, but only that it
     is a probable candidate.  When such a matrix is factorized, a
     Cholesky factorization is first attempted, and if that fails the
     matrix is then treated with an LU factorization.  Once the matrix
     has been factorized, `matrix_type' will return the correct
     classification of the matrix.

 -- Built-in Function:  norm (A)
 -- Built-in Function:  norm (A, P)
 -- Built-in Function:  norm (A, P, OPT)
     Compute the p-norm of the matrix A.  If the second argument is
     missing, `p = 2' is assumed.

     If A is a matrix (or sparse matrix):

    P = `1'
          1-norm, the largest column sum of the absolute values of A.

    P = `2'
          Largest singular value of A.

    P = `Inf' or `"inf"'
          Infinity norm, the largest row sum of the absolute values of
          A.

    P = `"fro"'
          Frobenius norm of A, `sqrt (sum (diag (A' * A)))'.

    other P, `P > 1'
          maximum `norm (A*x, p)' such that `norm (x, p) == 1'

     If A is a vector or a scalar:

    P = `Inf' or `"inf"'
          `max (abs (A))'.

    P = `-Inf'
          `min (abs (A))'.

    P = `"fro"'
          Frobenius norm of A, `sqrt (sumsq (abs (A)))'.

    P = 0
          Hamming norm - the number of nonzero elements.

    other P, `P > 1'
          p-norm of A, `(sum (abs (A) .^ P)) ^ (1/P)'.

    other P `P < 1'
          the p-pseudonorm defined as above.

     If OPT is the value `"rows"', treat each row as a vector and
     compute its norm.  The result is returned as a column vector.
     Similarly, if OPT is `"columns"' or `"cols"' then compute the
     norms of each column and return a row vector.

 -- Function File:  null (A)
 -- Function File:  null (A, TOL)
     Return an orthonormal basis of the null space of A.

     The dimension of the null space is taken as the number of singular
     values of A not greater than TOL.  If the argument TOL is missing,
     it is computed as

          max (size (A)) * max (svd (A)) * eps

     *See also:* *note orth: doc-orth.

 -- Function File:  orth (A)
 -- Function File:  orth (A, TOL)
     Return an orthonormal basis of the range space of A.

     The dimension of the range space is taken as the number of singular
     values of A greater than TOL.  If the argument TOL is missing, it
     is computed as

          max (size (A)) * max (svd (A)) * eps

     *See also:* *note null: doc-null.

 -- Loadable Function: [Y, H] = mgorth (X, V)
     Orthogonalize a given column vector X with respect to a given
     orthonormal basis V using a modified Gram-Schmidt
     orthogonalization.  On exit, Y is a unit vector such that:

            norm (Y) = 1
            V' * Y = 0
            X = H*[V, Y]


 -- Loadable Function:  pinv (X)
 -- Loadable Function:  pinv (X, TOL)
     Return the pseudoinverse of X.  Singular values less than TOL are
     ignored.

     If the second argument is omitted, it is taken to be

          tol = max (size (X)) * sigma_max (X) * eps,

     where `sigma_max (X)' is the maximal singular value of X.

 -- Function File:  rank (A)
 -- Function File:  rank (A, TOL)
     Compute the rank of A, using the singular value decomposition.
     The rank is taken to be the number of singular values of A that
     are greater than the specified tolerance TOL.  If the second
     argument is omitted, it is taken to be

          tol = max (size (A)) * sigma(1) * eps;

     where `eps' is machine precision and `sigma(1)' is the largest
     singular value of A.

 -- Loadable Function: C = rcond (A)
     Compute the 1-norm estimate of the reciprocal condition number as
     returned by LAPACK.  If the matrix is well-conditioned then C will
     be near 1 and if the matrix is poorly conditioned it will be close
     to zero.

     The matrix A must not be sparse.  If the matrix is sparse then
     `condest (A)' or `rcond (full (A))' should be used instead.

     *See also:* *note cond: doc-cond, *note condest: doc-condest.

 -- Function File:  trace (A)
     Compute the trace of A, `sum (diag (A))'.

 -- Function File:  rref (A)
 -- Function File:  rref (A, TOL)
 -- Function File: [R, K] = rref (...)
     Return the reduced row echelon form of A.  TOL defaults to `eps *
     max (size (A)) * norm (A, inf)'.

     Called with two return arguments, K returns the vector of "bound
     variables", which are those columns on which elimination has been
     performed.

18.3 Matrix Factorizations
==========================

 -- Loadable Function: R = chol (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [R, P] = chol (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [R, P, Q] = chol (S)
 -- Loadable Function: [R, P, Q] = chol (S, "vector")
 -- Loadable Function: [L, ...] = chol (..., "lower")
 -- Loadable Function: [L, ...] = chol (..., "upper")
     Compute the Cholesky factor, R, of the symmetric positive definite
     matrix A, where

          R' * R = A.

     Called with one output argument `chol' fails if A or S is not
     positive definite.  With two or more output arguments P flags
     whether the matrix was positive definite and `chol' does not fail.
     A zero value indicated that the matrix was positive definite and
     the R gives the factorization, and P will have a positive value
     otherwise.

     If called with 3 outputs then a sparsity preserving row/column
     permutation is applied to A prior to the factorization.  That is R
     is the factorization of `A(Q,Q)' such that

          R' * R = Q' * A * Q.

     The sparsity preserving permutation is generally returned as a
     matrix.  However, given the flag "vector", Q will be returned as a
     vector such that

          R' * R = A(Q, Q).

     Called with either a sparse or full matrix and using the "lower"
     flag, `chol' returns the lower triangular factorization such that

          L * L' = A.

     For full matrices, if the "lower" flag is set only the lower
     triangular part of the matrix is used for the factorization,
     otherwise the upper triangular part is used.

     In general the lower triangular factorization is significantly
     faster for sparse matrices.

     *See also:* *note cholinv: doc-cholinv, *note chol2inv:
     doc-chol2inv.

 -- Loadable Function:  cholinv (A)
     Use the Cholesky factorization to compute the inverse of the
     symmetric positive definite matrix A.

     *See also:* *note chol: doc-chol, *note chol2inv: doc-chol2inv,
     *note inv: doc-inv.

 -- Loadable Function:  chol2inv (U)
     Invert a symmetric, positive definite square matrix from its
     Cholesky decomposition, U.  Note that U should be an
     upper-triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements.
     `chol2inv (U)' provides `inv (U'*U)' but it is much faster than
     using `inv'.

     *See also:* *note chol: doc-chol, *note cholinv: doc-cholinv,
     *note inv: doc-inv.

 -- Loadable Function: [R1, INFO] = cholupdate (R, U, OP)
     Update or downdate a Cholesky factorization.  Given an upper
     triangular matrix R and a column vector U, attempt to determine
     another upper triangular matrix R1 such that

        * R1'*R1 = R'*R + U*U' if OP is "+"

        * R1'*R1 = R'*R - U*U' if OP is "-"

     If OP is "-", INFO is set to

        * 0 if the downdate was successful,

        * 1 if R'*R - U*U' is not positive definite,

        * 2 if R is singular.

     If INFO is not present, an error message is printed in cases 1 and
     2.

 -- Loadable Function: R1 = cholinsert (R, J, U)
 -- Loadable Function: [R1, INFO] = cholinsert (R, J, U)
     Given a Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric or complex
     Hermitian positive definite matrix A = R'*R, R upper triangular,
     return the Cholesky factorization of A1, where A1(p,p) = A,
     A1(:,j) = A1(j,:)' = u and p = [1:j-1,j+1:n+1].  u(j) should be
     positive.  On return, INFO is set to

        * 0 if the insertion was successful,

        * 1 if A1 is not positive definite,

        * 2 if R is singular.

     If INFO is not present, an error message is printed in cases 1 and
     2.

 -- Loadable Function: R1 = choldelete (R, J)
     Given a Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric or complex
     Hermitian positive definite matrix A = R'*R, R upper triangular,
     return the Cholesky factorization of A(p,p), where
     p = [1:j-1,j+1:n+1].

     *See also:* *note chol: doc-chol, *note cholupdate:
     doc-cholupdate, *note cholinsert: doc-cholinsert.

 -- Loadable Function: R1 = cholshift (R, I, J)
     Given a Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric or complex
     Hermitian positive definite matrix A = R'*R, R upper triangular,
     return the Cholesky factorization of A(p,p), where p is the
     permutation
     `p = [1:i-1, shift(i:j, 1), j+1:n]' if I < J
     or
     `p = [1:j-1, shift(j:i,-1), i+1:n]' if J < I.

 -- Loadable Function: H = hess (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [P, H] = hess (A)
     Compute the Hessenberg decomposition of the matrix A.

     The Hessenberg decomposition is `P * H * P' = A' where P is a
     square unitary matrix (`P' * P = I', using complex-conjugate
     transposition) and H is upper Hessenberg (`H(i, j) = 0 forall i >=
     j+1)'.

     The Hessenberg decomposition is usually used as the first step in
     an eigenvalue computation, but has other applications as well (see
     Golub, Nash, and Van Loan, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,
     1979).

 -- Loadable Function: [L, U] = lu (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [L, U, P] = lu (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [L, U, P, Q] = lu (S)
 -- Loadable Function: [L, U, P, Q, R] = lu (S)
 -- Loadable Function: [...] = lu (S, THRES)
 -- Loadable Function: Y = lu (...)
 -- Loadable Function: [...] = lu (..., "vector")
     Compute the LU decomposition of A.  If A is full subroutines from
     LAPACK are used and if A is sparse then UMFPACK is used.  The
     result is returned in a permuted form, according to the optional
     return value P.  For example, given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [l, u, p] = lu (A)

     returns

          l =

            1.00000  0.00000
            0.33333  1.00000

          u =

            3.00000  4.00000
            0.00000  0.66667

          p =

            0  1
            1  0

     The matrix is not required to be square.

     When called with two or three output arguments and a spare input
     matrix, `lu' does not attempt to perform sparsity preserving column
     permutations.  Called with a fourth output argument, the sparsity
     preserving column transformation Q is returned, such that `P * A *
     Q = L * U'.

     Called with a fifth output argument and a sparse input matrix,
     `lu' attempts to use a scaling factor R on the input matrix such
     that `P * (R \ A) * Q = L * U'.  This typically leads to a sparser
     and more stable factorization.

     An additional input argument THRES, that defines the pivoting
     threshold can be given.  THRES can be a scalar, in which case it
     defines the UMFPACK pivoting tolerance for both symmetric and
     unsymmetric cases.  If THRES is a 2-element vector, then the first
     element defines the pivoting tolerance for the unsymmetric UMFPACK
     pivoting strategy and the second for the symmetric strategy.  By
     default, the values defined by `spparms' are used ([0.1, 0.001]).

     Given the string argument "vector", `lu' returns the values of P
     and Q as vector values, such that for full matrix, `A (P,:) = L *
     U', and `R(P,:) * A (:, Q) = L * U'.

     With two output arguments, returns the permuted forms of the upper
     and lower triangular matrices, such that `A = L * U'.  With one
     output argument Y, then the matrix returned by the LAPACK routines
     is returned.  If the input matrix is sparse then the matrix L is
     embedded into U to give a return value similar to the full case.
     For both full and sparse matrices, `lu' loses the permutation
     information.

 -- Loadable Function: [L, U] = luupdate (L, U, X, Y)
 -- Loadable Function: [L, U, P] = luupdate (L, U, P, X, Y)
     Given an LU factorization of a real or complex matrix A = L*U,
     L lower unit trapezoidal and U upper trapezoidal, return the
     LU factorization of A + X*Y.', where X and Y are column vectors
     (rank-1 update) or matrices with equal number of columns (rank-k
     update).  Optionally, row-pivoted updating can be used by supplying
     a row permutation (pivoting) matrix P; in that case, an updated
     permutation matrix is returned.  Note that if L, U, P is a pivoted
     LU factorization as obtained by `lu':

          [L, U, P] = lu (A);

     then a factorization of A+X*Y.' can be obtained either as

          [L1, U1] = lu (L, U, P*X, Y)

     or

          [L1, U1, P1] = lu (L, U, P, X, Y)

     The first form uses the unpivoted algorithm, which is faster, but
     less stable.  The second form uses a slower pivoted algorithm,
     which is more stable.

     The matrix case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates; thus, for
     large enough k, it will be both faster and more accurate to
     recompute the factorization from scratch.

 -- Loadable Function: [Q, R, P] = qr (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [Q, R, P] = qr (A, '0')
 -- Loadable Function: [C, R] = qr (A, B)
 -- Loadable Function: [C, R] = qr (A, B, '0')
     Compute the QR factorization of A, using standard LAPACK
     subroutines.  For example, given the matrix `A = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [Q, R] = qr (A)

     returns

          Q =

            -0.31623  -0.94868
            -0.94868   0.31623

          R =

            -3.16228  -4.42719
             0.00000  -0.63246

     The `qr' factorization has applications in the solution of least
     squares problems

          min norm(A x - b)

     for overdetermined systems of equations (i.e., A  is a tall, thin
     matrix).  The QR factorization is `Q * Q = A' where Q is an
     orthogonal matrix and R is upper triangular.

     If given a second argument of '0', `qr' returns an economy-sized
     QR factorization, omitting zero rows of R and the corresponding
     columns of Q.

     If the matrix A is full, the permuted QR factorization `[Q, R, P]
     = qr (A)' forms the QR factorization such that the diagonal
     entries of R are decreasing in magnitude order.  For example,
     given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [Q, R, P] = qr (A)

     returns

          Q =

            -0.44721  -0.89443
            -0.89443   0.44721

          R =

            -4.47214  -3.13050
             0.00000   0.44721

          P =

             0  1
             1  0

     The permuted `qr' factorization `[Q, R, P] = qr (A)' factorization
     allows the construction of an orthogonal basis of `span (A)'.

     If the matrix A is sparse, then compute the sparse
     QR factorization of A, using CSPARSE.  As the matrix Q is in
     general a full matrix, this function returns the Q-less
     factorization R of A, such that `R = chol (A' * A)'.

     If the final argument is the scalar `0' and the number of rows is
     larger than the number of columns, then an economy factorization is
     returned.  That is R will have only `size (A,1)' rows.

     If an additional matrix B is supplied, then `qr' returns C, where
     `C = Q' * B'.  This allows the least squares approximation of `A \
     B' to be calculated as

          [C, R] = qr (A, B)
          x = R \ C

 -- Loadable Function: [Q1, R1] = qrupdate (Q, R, U, V)
     Given a QR factorization of a real or complex matrix A = Q*R,
     Q unitary and R upper trapezoidal, return the QR factorization of
     A + U*V', where U and V are column vectors (rank-1 update) or
     matrices with equal number of columns (rank-k update).  Notice
     that the latter case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates;
     thus, for k large enough, it will be both faster and more accurate
     to recompute the factorization from scratch.

     The QR factorization supplied may be either full (Q is square) or
     economized (R is square).

     Given a QR factorization of a real or complex matrix A = Q*R,

     [A(:,1:j-1) x A(:,j:n)], where U is a column vector to be inserted
     into A (if ORIENT is `"col"'), or the QR factorization of
     [A(1:j-1,:);x;A(:,j:n)], where X is a row vector to be inserted
     into A (if ORIENT is `"row"').

     The default value of ORIENT is `"col"'.  If ORIENT is `"col"', U
     may be a matrix and J an index vector resulting in the
     QR factorization of a matrix B such that B(:,J) gives U and
     B(:,J) = [] gives A.  Notice that the latter case is done as a
     sequence of k insertions; thus, for k large enough, it will be
     both faster and more accurate to recompute the factorization from
     scratch.

     If ORIENT is `"col"', the QR factorization supplied may be either
     full (Q is square) or economized (R is square).

     If ORIENT is `"row"', full factorization is needed.

     [A(:,1:j-1) A(:,j+1:n)], i.e., A with one column deleted (if
     ORIENT is "col"), or the QR factorization of
     [A(1:j-1,:);A(j+1:n,:)], i.e., A with one row deleted (if ORIENT
     is "row").

     The default value of ORIENT is "col".

     If ORIENT is `"col"', J may be an index vector resulting in the
     QR factorization of a matrix B such that A(:,J) = [] gives B.
     Notice that the latter case is done as a sequence of k deletions;
     thus, for k large enough, it will be both faster and more accurate
     to recompute the factorization from scratch.

     If ORIENT is `"col"', the QR factorization supplied may be either

     QZ decomposition of the generalized eigenvalue problem (A x = s B

       1. `LAMBDA = qz (A, B)'

          Computes the generalized eigenvalues LAMBDA of (A - s B).

       2. `[AA, BB, Q, Z, V, W, LAMBDA] = qz (A, B)'

          Computes QZ decomposition, generalized eigenvectors, and

          As in form [2], but allows ordering of generalized eigenpairs
          for (e.g.) solution of discrete time algebraic Riccati
          equations.  Form 3 is not available for complex matrices, and
          does not compute the generalized eigenvectors V, W, nor the
          orthogonal matrix Q.

         OPT
               for ordering eigenvalues of the GEP pencil.  The leading
               block of the revised pencil contains all eigenvalues
               that satisfy:

              "N"
                    = unordered (default)

              "S"
                    = small: leading block has all |lambda| <= 1

              "B"
                    = big: leading block has all |lambda| >= 1

              "-"
                    = negative real part: leading block has all
                    eigenvalues in the open left half-plane

              "+"
                    = non-negative real part: leading block has all
                    eigenvalues in the closed right half-plane

     Note: `qz' performs permutation balancing, but not scaling (*note
     doc-balance::).  The order of output arguments was selected for
     compatibility with MATLAB.

 -- Function File: [AA, BB, Q, Z] = qzhess (A, B)
     Compute the Hessenberg-triangular decomposition of the matrix
     pencil `(A, B)', returning `AA = Q * A * Z', `BB = Q * B * Z',
     with Q and Z orthogonal.  For example:

          [aa, bb, q, z] = qzhess ([1, 2; 3, 4], [5, 6; 7, 8])
               => aa = [ -3.02244, -4.41741;  0.92998,  0.69749 ]
               => bb = [ -8.60233, -9.99730;  0.00000, -0.23250 ]
               =>  q = [ -0.58124, -0.81373; -0.81373,  0.58124 ]
               =>  z = [ 1, 0; 0, 1 ]

     The Hessenberg-triangular decomposition is the first step in Moler
     and Stewart's QZ decomposition algorithm.

 -- Loadable Function: S = schur (A)
 -- Loadable Function: S = schur (A, "real")
 -- Loadable Function: S = schur (A, "complex")
 -- Loadable Function: S = schur (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [U, S] = schur (A, ...)
     Compute the Schur decomposition of A

          `S = U' * A * U'

     where U is a unitary matrix (`U'* U' is identity) and S is upper
     triangular.  The eigenvalues of A (and S) are the diagonal
     elements of S.  If the matrix A is real, then the real
     Schur decomposition is computed, in which the matrix U is
     orthogonal and S is block upper triangular with blocks of size at
     most `2 x 2' along the diagonal.  The diagonal elements of S (or
     the eigenvalues of the `2 x 2' blocks, when appropriate) are the
     eigenvalues of A and S.

     The default for real matrices is a real Schur decomposition.  A
     complex decomposition may be forced by passing the flag "complex".

     The eigenvalues are optionally ordered along the diagonal
     according to the value of OPT.  `OPT = "a"' indicates that all
     eigenvalues with negative real parts should be moved to the leading
     block of S (used in `are'), `OPT = "d"' indicates that all
     eigenvalues with magnitude less than one should be moved to the
     leading block of S (used in `dare'), and `OPT = "u"', the default,
     indicates that no ordering of eigenvalues should occur.  The
     leading K columns of U always span the A-invariant subspace
     corresponding to the K leading eigenvalues of S.

     The Schur decomposition is used to compute eigenvalues of a square
     matrix, and has applications in the solution of algebraic Riccati
     equations in control (see `are' and `dare').

 -- Function File: [U, T] = rsf2csf (UR, TR)
     Convert a real, upper quasi-triangular Schur form TR to a complex,
     upper triangular Schur form T.

     Note that the following relations hold:

     UR * TR * UR' = U * T * U' and `U' * U' is the identity matrix I.

     Note also that U and T are not unique.

 -- Function File: ANGLE = subspace (A, B)
     Determine the largest principal angle between two subspaces
     spanned by the columns of matrices A and B.

 -- Loadable Function: S = svd (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [U, S, V] = svd (A)
 -- Loadable Function: [U, S, V] = svd (A, ECON)
     Compute the singular value decomposition of A

          A = U*S*V'

     The function `svd' normally returns only the vector of singular
     values.  When called with three return values, it computes U, S,
     and V.  For example,

          svd (hilb (3))

     returns

          ans =

            1.4083189
            0.1223271
            0.0026873

     and

          [u, s, v] = svd (hilb (3))

     returns

          u =

            -0.82704   0.54745   0.12766
            -0.45986  -0.52829  -0.71375
            -0.32330  -0.64901   0.68867

          s =

            1.40832  0.00000  0.00000
            0.00000  0.12233  0.00000
            0.00000  0.00000  0.00269

          v =

            -0.82704   0.54745   0.12766
            -0.45986  -0.52829  -0.71375
            -0.32330  -0.64901   0.68867

     If given a second argument, `svd' returns an economy-sized
     decomposition, eliminating the unnecessary rows or columns of U or
     V.

 -- Loadable Function: VAL = svd_driver ()
 -- Loadable Function: OLD_VAL = svd_driver (NEW_VAL)
 -- Loadable Function:  svd_driver (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the underlying LAPACK driver used by `svd'.
     Currently recognized values are "gesvd" and "gesdd".  The default
     is "gesvd".

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines
     it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting
     the function.

 -- Function File: [HOUSV, BETA, ZER] = housh (X, J, Z)
     Compute Householder reflection vector HOUSV to reflect X to be the
     j-th column of identity, i.e.,

          (I - beta*housv*housv')x =  norm(x)*e(j) if x(j) < 0,
          (I - beta*housv*housv')x = -norm(x)*e(j) if x(j) >= 0

     Inputs

    X
          vector

    J
          index into vector

    Z
          threshold for zero  (usually should be the number 0)

     Outputs (see Golub and Van Loan):

    BETA
          If beta = 0, then no reflection need be applied (zer set to 0)

    HOUSV
          householder vector

 -- Function File: [U, H, NU] = krylov (A, V, K, EPS1, PFLG)
     Construct an orthogonal basis U of block Krylov subspace

          [v a*v a^2*v ... a^(k+1)*v]

     Using Householder reflections to guard against loss of
     orthogonality.

     If V is a vector, then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that
     a*u == u*h+rk*ek', in which `rk = a*u(:,k)-u*h(:,k)', and ek' is
     the vector `[0, 0, ..., 1]' of length `k'.  Otherwise, H is
     meaningless.

     If V is a vector and K is greater than `length(A)-1', then H
     contains the Hessenberg matrix such that `a*u == u*h'.

     The value of NU is the dimension of the span of the Krylov
     subspace (based on EPS1).

     If B is a vector and K is greater than M-1, then H contains the
     Hessenberg decomposition of A.

     The optional parameter EPS1 is the threshold for zero.  The
     default value is 1e-12.

     If the optional parameter PFLG is nonzero, row pivoting is used to
     improve numerical behavior.  The default value is 0.
