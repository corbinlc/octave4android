 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, OUTPUT] = shell_cmd (...)
 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, OUTPUT] = shell_cmd (STRING, RETURN_OUTPUT, TYPE)
     Execute a shell command specified by STRING.  If the optional argument TYPE is "async", the process is started in the background and the process id of the child process is returned immediately.  Otherwise, the process is started and Octave waits until it exits.  If the TYPE argument is omitted, it defaults to a value of "sync".

     If the optional argument RETURN_OUTPUT is true and the subprocess is started synchronously, or if SHELL_CMD is called with one input argument and one or more output arguments, then the output from the command is returned.  Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously, its output is sent to the standard output.

     The `shell_cmd' function can return two values.  The first is the exit status of the command and the second is any output from the command that was written to the standard output stream.  For example,

          [status, output] = shell_cmd ("echo foo; exit 2");

     will set the variable `output' to the string `foo', and the variable `status' to the integer `2'.

     For commands run asynchronously, STATUS is the process id of the command shell that is started to run the command.

 -- Function File:  accumarray (SUBS, VALS, SZ, FUNC, FILLVAL, ISSPARSE)
 -- Function File:  accumarray (SUBS, VALS, ...)
     Create an array by accumulating the elements of a vector into the positions defined by their subscripts.  The subscripts are defined by the rows of the matrix SUBS and the values by VALS.  Each row of SUBS corresponds to one of the values in VALS.  If VALS is a scalar, it will be used for each of the row of SUBS.  If SUBS is a cell array of vectors, all vectors must be of the same length, and the subscripts in the Kth vector must correspond to the Kth dimension of the result.

     The size of the matrix will be determined by the subscripts themselves.  However, if SZ is defined it determines the matrix size.  The length of SZ must correspond to the number of columns in SUBS.  An exception is if SUBS has only one column, in which case SZ may be the dimensions of a vector and the subscripts of SUBS are taken as the indices into it.

     The default action of `accumarray' is to sum the elements with the same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that accepts a column vector and returns a scalar.  The result of the function should not depend on the order of the subscripts.

     The elements of the returned array that have no subscripts associated with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some other value allows these values to be defined.  This behavior changes, however, for certain values of FUNC.  If FUNC is `min' (respectively, `max') then the result will be filled with the minimum (respectively, maximum) integer if VALS is of integral type, logical false (respectively, logical true) if VALS is of logical type, zero if FILLVAL is zero and all values are non-positive (respectively, non-negative), and NaN otherwise.

     By default `accumarray' returns a full matrix.  If ISSPARSE is logically true, then a sparse matrix is returned instead.

     The following `accumarray' example constructs a frequency table that in the first column counts how many occurrences each number in the second column has, taken from the vector X.  Note the usage of `unique'  for assigning to all repeated elements of X the same index (*note doc-unique::).

          X = [91, 92, 90, 92, 90, 89, 91, 89, 90, 100, 100, 100];
          [U, ~, J] = unique (X);
          [accumarray(J', 1), U']
            =>  2    89
                3    90
                2    91
                2    92
                3   100

     Another example, where the result is a multi-dimensional 3-D array and the default value (zero) appears in the output:

          accumarray ([1, 1, 1;
                       2, 1, 2;
                       2, 3, 2;
                       2, 1, 2;
                       2, 3, 2], 101:105)
          => ans(:,:,1) = [101, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]
          => ans(:,:,2) = [0, 0, 0; 206, 0, 208]

     The sparse option can be used as an alternative to the `sparse' constructor (*note doc-sparse::).  Thus

          sparse (I, J, SV)

     can be written with `accumarray' as

          accumarray ([I, J], SV', [], [], 0, true)

     For repeated indices, `sparse' adds the corresponding value.  To take the minimum instead, use `min' as an accumulator function:

          accumarray ([I, J], SV', [], @min, 0, true)

     The complexity of accumarray in general for the non-sparse case is generally O(M+N), where N is the number of subscripts and M is the maximum subscript (linearized in multi-dimensional case).  If FUNC is one of `@sum' (default), `@max', `@min' or `@(x) {x}', an optimized code path is used.  Note that for general reduction function the interpreter overhead can play a major part and it may be more efficient to do multiple accumarray calls and compute the results in a vectorized manner.

 -- Function File:  accumdim (SUBS, VALS, DIM, N, FUNC, FILLVAL)
     Create an array by accumulating the slices of an array into the positions defined by their subscripts along a specified dimension.  The subscripts are defined by the index vector SUBS.  The dimension is specified by DIM.  If not given, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.  The length of SUBS must be equal to `size (VALS, DIM)'.

     The extent of the result matrix in the working dimension will be determined by the subscripts themselves.  However, if N is defined it determines this extent.

     The default action of `accumdim' is to sum the subarrays with the same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that accepts an array and a dimension, and reduces the array along this dimension.  As a special exception, the built-in `min' and `max' functions can be used directly, and `accumdim' accounts for the middle empty argument that is used in their calling.

     The slices of the returned array that have no subscripts associated with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some other value allows these values to be defined.

     An example of the use of `accumdim' is:

          accumdim ([1, 2, 1, 2, 1], [ 7, -10,   4;
                                      -5, -12,   8;

 -- Function File: Y = circshift (X, N)
     Circularly shift the values of the array X.  N must be a vector of integers no longer than the number of dimensions in X.  The values of N can be either positive or negative, which determines the direction in which the values or X are shifted.  If an element of N is zero, then the corresponding dimension of X will not be shifted.  For example:

          x = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
          circshift (x, 1)

 -- Function File: [ERR, Y1, ...] = common_size (X1, ...)
     Determine if all input arguments are either scalar or of common size.  If so, ERR is zero, and YI is a matrix of the common size with all entries equal to XI if this is a scalar or XI otherwise.  If the inputs cannot be brought to a common size, ERR is 1, and YI is XI.  For example:

          [errorcode, a, b] = common_size ([1 2; 3 4], 5)
               => errorcode = 0
               => a = [ 1, 2; 3, 4 ]

     Sort the numbers Z into complex conjugate pairs ordered by increasing real part.  Place the negative imaginary complex number first within each pair.  Place all the real numbers (those with `abs (imag (Z) / Z) < TOL)') after the complex pairs.

     If TOL is unspecified the default value is 100*`eps'.

     By default the complex pairs are sorted along the first non-singleton dimension of Z.  If DIM is specified, then the complex pairs are sorted along this dimension.

     Signal an error if some complex numbers could not be paired.  Signal an error if all complex numbers are not exact conjugates (to within TOL).  Note that there is no defined order for pairs with identical real parts but differing imaginary parts.

 -- Function File: Q = cumtrapz (Y)

 -- Function File: Q = cumtrapz (..., DIM)
     Cumulative numerical integration of points Y using the trapezoidal method.  `cumtrapz (Y)' computes the cumulative integral of Y along the first non-singleton dimension.  Where `trapz' reports only the overall integral sum, `cumtrapz' reports the current partial sum value at each point of Y.  When the argument X is omitted an equally spaced X vector with unit spacing (1) is assumed.  `cumtrapz (X, Y)' evaluates the integral with respect to the spacing in X and the values in Y.  This is useful if the points in Y have been sampled unevenly.  If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

     If X is not specified then unit spacing will be used.  To scale the integral to the correct value you must multiply by the actual spacing value (deltaX).

     Numerically evaluate the double integral of F.  F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must have the form z = f(x,y) where X is a vector and Y is a scalar.  It should return a vector of the same length and orientation as X.

     XA, YA and XB, YB are the lower and upper limits of integration for x and y respectively.  The underlying integrator determines whether infinite bounds are accepted.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to integrate each sub-integral.  The default value is 1e^-6.

     The optional argument QUADF specifies which underlying integrator function to use.  Any choice but `quad' is available and the default is `quadcc'.

     Additional arguments, are passed directly to F.  To use the default value for TOL or QUADF one may pass ':' or an empty matrix ([]).

     Calculate the discrete Laplace operator.  For a 2-dimensional matrix M this is defined as

                1    / d^2            d^2         \
          D  = --- * | ---  M(x,y) +  ---  M(x,y) |
                4    \ dx^2           dy^2        /

     For N-dimensional arrays the sum in parentheses is expanded to include second derivatives over the additional higher dimensions.

     The spacing between evaluation points may be defined by H, which is a scalar defining the equidistant spacing in all dimensions.  Alternatively, the spacing in each dimension may be defined separately by DX, DY, etc.  A scalar spacing argument defines equidistant spacing, whereas a vector argument can be used to specify variable spacing.  The length of the spacing vectors must match the respective dimension of M.  The default spacing value is 1.

     At least 3 data points are needed for each dimension.  Boundary points are calculated from the linear extrapolation of interior points.

 -- Function File: VARNAME = genvarname (STR)
 -- Function File: VARNAME = genvarname (STR, EXCLUSIONS)
     Create unique variable(s) from STR.  If EXCLUSIONS is given, then the variable(s) will be unique to each other and to EXCLUSIONS (EXCLUSIONS may be either a string or a cellstr).

     If STR is a cellstr, then a unique variable is created for each cell in STR.

          x = 3.141;
          genvarname ("x", who ())
            => x1

     If WANTED is a cell array, genvarname will make sure the returned strings are distinct:

          genvarname ({"foo", "foo"})
            =>
               {
                 [1,1] = foo
                 [1,2] = foo1
               }

     Note that the result is a char array/cell array of strings, not the variables themselves.  To define a variable, `eval()' can be used.  The following trivial example sets `x' to `42'.

          name = genvarname ("x");
          eval ([name " = 42"]);
            => x =  42

     Also, this can be useful for creating unique struct field names.

          x = struct ();
          for i = 1:3
            x.(genvarname ("a", fieldnames (x))) = i;
          endfor
            => x =
               {
                 a =  1
                 a1 =  2
                 a2 =  3
               }

     Since variable names may only contain letters, digits and underscores, genvarname replaces any sequence of disallowed characters with an underscore.  Also, variables may not begin with a digit; in this case an underscore is added before the variable name.

     Variable names beginning and ending with two underscores "__" are valid but they are used internally by octave and should generally be avoided, therefore genvarname will not generate such names.

     genvarname will also make sure that returned names do not clash with keywords such as "for" and "if".  A number will be appended if necessary.  Note, however, that this does *not* include function names, such as "sin".  Such names should be included in AVOID if necessary.

     Calculate the gradient of sampled data or a function.  If M is a vector, calculate the one-dimensional gradient of M.  If M is a matrix the gradient is calculated for each dimension.

     `[DX, DY] = gradient (M)' calculates the one dimensional gradient for X and Y direction if M is a matrix.  Additional return arguments can be use for multi-dimensional matrices.

     A constant spacing between two points can be provided by the S parameter.  If S is a scalar, it is assumed to be the spacing for all dimensions.  Otherwise, separate values of the spacing can be supplied by the X, ... arguments.  Scalar values specify an equidistant spacing.  Vector values for the X, ... arguments specify the coordinate for that dimension.  The length must match their respective dimension of M.

     At boundary points a linear extrapolation is applied.  Interior points are calculated with the first approximation of the numerical gradient

          y'(i) = 1/(x(i+1)-x(i-1)) * (y(i-1)-y(i+1)).

     If the first argument F is a function handle, the gradient of the function at the points in X0 is approximated using central difference.  For example, `gradient (@cos, 0)' approximates the gradient of the cosine function in the point x0 = 0.  As with sampled data, the spacing values between the points from which the gradient is estimated can be set via the S or DX, DY, ... arguments.  By default a spacing of 1 is used.

 -- Function File:  idivide (X, Y, OP)
     Integer division with different rounding rules.

     The standard behavior of integer division such as `A ./ B' is to round the result to the nearest integer.  This is not always the desired behavior and `idivide' permits integer element-by-element division to be performed with different treatment for the fractional part of the division as determined by the OP flag.  OP is a string with one of the values:

    "fix"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards zero.

    "round"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards the nearest integer.

    "floor"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards negative infinity.

    "ceil"
          Calculate `A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards positive infinity.

     If OP is not given it defaults to `"fix"'.  An example demonstrating these rounding rules is

          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "fix")
            => int8 ([0, 0])
          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "round")
            => int8 ([-1, 1])
          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "floor")
            => int8 ([-1, 0])
          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "ceil")
            => int8 ([0, 1])

 -- Function File: YI = interp1 (Y, XI)
 -- Function File: YI = interp1 (..., METHOD)
 -- Function File: YI = interp1 (..., EXTRAP)
 -- Function File: PP = interp1 (..., "pp")
     One-dimensional interpolation.  Interpolate Y, defined at the points X, at the points XI.  The sample points X must be monotonic.  If not specified, X is taken to be the indices of Y.  If Y is an array, treat the columns of Y separately.

     Method is one of:

    "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    "linear"
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors

    "pchip"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial

    "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation (same as `pchip')

    "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve

     Appending '*' to the start of the above method forces `interp1' to assume that X is uniformly spaced, and only `X (1)' and `X (2)' are referenced.  This is usually faster, and is never slower.  The default method is "linear".

     If EXTRAP is the string "extrap", then extrapolate values beyond the endpoints.  If EXTRAP is a number, replace values beyond the endpoints with that number.  If EXTRAP is missing, assume NA.

     If the string argument "pp" is specified, then XI should not be supplied and `interp1' returns the piecewise polynomial that can later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the interpolation.  There is an equivalence, such that `ppval (interp1 (X, Y, METHOD, "pp"), XI) == interp1 (X, Y, XI, METHOD, "extrap")'.

     Duplicate points in X specify a discontinuous interpolant.  There should be at most 2 consecutive points with the same value.  The discontinuous interpolant is right-continuous if X is increasing, left-continuous if it is decreasing.  Discontinuities are (currently) only allowed for "nearest" and "linear" methods; in all other cases, X must be strictly monotonic.

     An example of the use of `interp1' is

          xf = [0:0.05:10];
          yf = sin (2*pi*xf/5);
          xp = [0:10];
          yp = sin (2*pi*xp/5);
          lin = interp1 (xp, yp, xf);
          spl = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "spline");
          cub = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "cubic");
          near = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "nearest");
          plot (xf, yf, "r", xf, lin, "g", xf, spl, "b",
                xf, cub, "c", xf, near, "m", xp, yp, "r*");

 -- Function File: YI = interp1q (X, Y, XI)
     One-dimensional linear interpolation without error checking.  Interpolates Y, defined at the points X, at the points XI.  The sample points X must be a strictly monotonically increasing column vector.  If Y is an array, treat the columns of Y separately.  If Y is a vector, it must be a column vector of the same length as X.

     Values of XI beyond the endpoints of the interpolation result in NA being returned.

     Note that the error checking is only a significant portion of the execution time of this `interp1' if the size of the input arguments is relatively small.  Therefore, the benefit of using `interp1q' is relatively small.

 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (Z, N)
 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (..., METHOD)
 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (..., METHOD, EXTRAPVAL)
     Two-dimensional interpolation.  X, Y and Z describe a surface function.  If X and Y are vectors their length must correspondent to the size of Z.  X and Y must be monotonic.  If they are matrices they must have the `meshgrid' format.

    `interp2 (X, Y, Z, XI, YI, ...)'
          Returns a matrix corresponding to the points described by the matrices XI, YI.

          If the last argument is a string, the interpolation method can be specified.  The method can be "linear", "nearest" or "cubic".  If it is omitted "linear" interpolation is assumed.

    `interp2 (Z, XI, YI)'
          Assumes `X = 1:rows (Z)' and `Y = 1:columns (Z)'

    `interp2 (Z, N)'
          Interleaves the matrix Z n-times.  If N is omitted a value of `N = 1' is assumed.

     The variable METHOD defines the method to use for the interpolation.  It can take one of the following values

    "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    "linear"
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    "pchip"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial.

    "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors.

    "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve.

     If a scalar value EXTRAPVAL is defined as the final value, then values outside the mesh as set to this value.  Note that in this case METHOD must be defined as well.  If EXTRAPVAL is not defined then NA is assumed.

     Check for correct number of arguments or generate an error message if the number of arguments in the calling function is outside the range MINARGS and MAXARGS.  Otherwise, do nothing.

     Both MINARGS and MAXARGS need to be scalar numeric values.  Zero, Inf and negative values are all allowed, and MINARGS and MAXARGS may be equal.

     Check for correct number of output arguments.

     On the first form, returns an error unless the number of arguments in its caller is between the values of MINARGS and MAXARGS.  It does nothing otherwise.  Note that this function evaluates the value of `nargout' on the caller so its value must have not been tampered with.

     Both MINARGS and MAXARGS need to be a numeric scalar.  Zero, Inf and negative are all valid, and they can have the same value.

     For backward compatibility reasons, the other forms return an appropriate error message string (or structure) if the number of outputs requested is invalid.

     This is useful for checking to see that the number of output arguments supplied to a function is within an acceptable range.

 -- Function File:  nthargout (N, FUNC, ...)
 -- Function File:  nthargout (N, NTOT, FUNC, ...)
     Return the Nth output argument of function given by the function handle or string FUNC.  Any arguments after FUNC are passed to FUNC.  The total number of arguments to call FUNC with can be passed in NTOT; by default NTOT is N.  The input N can also be a vector of indices of the output, in which case the output will be a cell array of the requested output arguments.

     The intended use `nthargout' is to avoid intermediate variables.  For example, when finding the indices of the maximum entry of a matrix, the following two compositions of nthargout

          M = magic (5);
          cell2mat (nthargout ([1, 2], @ind2sub, size(M),
                               nthargout (2, @max, M(:))))
          => 5   3

     are completely equivalent to the following lines:

          M = magic(5);
          [~, idx] = max (M(:));
          [i, j] = ind2sub (size (M), idx);
          [i, j]
          => 5   3

     It can also be helpful to have all output arguments in a single cell in the following manner:

          USV = nthargout ([1:3], @svd, hilb (5));

     Convert a number (or array) to a string (or a character array).  The optional second argument may either give the number of significant digits (PRECISION) to be used in the output or a format template string (FORMAT) as in `sprintf' (*note Formatted Output::).  `num2str' can also handle complex numbers.  For example:

          num2str (123.456)
               => "123.46"

          num2str (123.456, 4)
               => "123.5"

          s = num2str ([1, 1.34; 3, 3.56], "%5.1f")
               => s =
                  1.0  1.3
                  3.0  3.6
          whos s

                     s           2x8                         16  char

          num2str (1.234 + 27.3i)
               => "1.234+27.3i"

     The `num2str' function is not very flexible.  For better control over the results, use `sprintf' (*note Formatted Output::).  Note that for complex X, the format string may only contain one output conversion specification and nothing else.  Otherwise, you will get unpredictable results.

     Control the built-in profiler.

    `profile on'
          Start the profiler, clearing all previously collected data if there is any.

    `profile off'
          Stop profiling.  The collected data can later be retrieved and examined with calls like `S = profile ("info")'.

    `profile clear'
          Clear all collected profiler data.

    `profile resume'
          Restart profiling without cleaning up the old data and instead all newly collected statistics are added to the already existing ones.

    `S = profile ("status")'
          Return a structure filled with certain information about the current status of the profiler.  At the moment, the only field is `ProfilerStatus' which is either "on" or "off".

    `T = profile ("info")'
          Return the collected profiling statistics in the structure T.  The flat profile is returned in the field `FunctionTable' which is an array of structures, each entry corresponding to a function which was called and for which profiling statistics are present.  Furthermore, the field `Hierarchical' contains the hierarchical call-tree.  Each node has an index into the `FunctionTable' identifying the function it corresponds to as well as data fields for number of calls and time spent at this level in the call-tree.

 -- Function File: Q = quadgk (F, A, B)
 -- Function File: Q = quadgk (F, A, B, ABSTOL)

 -- Function File: Q = quadgk (F, A, B, PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- Function File: [Q, ERR] = quadgk (...)
     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using adaptive Gauss-Konrod quadrature.  F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The formulation is based on a proposal by L.F. Shampine, `"Vectorized adaptive quadrature in MATLAB", Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, pp131-140, Vol 211, Issue 2, Feb 2008' where all function evaluations at an iteration are calculated with a single call to F.  Therefore, the function F must be vectorized and must accept a vector of input values X and return an output vector representing the function evaluations at the given values of X.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or both limits may be infinite or contain weak end singularities.  Variable transformation will be used to treat any infinite intervals and weaken the singularities.  For example:

          quadgk (@(x) 1 ./ (sqrt (x) .* (x + 1)), 0, Inf)

     Note that the formulation of the integrand uses the element-by-element operator `./' and all user functions to `quadgk' should do the same.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to stop the integration procedure.  The default value is 1e^-10.

     The algorithm used by `quadgk' involves subdividing the integration interval and evaluating each subinterval.  If TRACE is true then after computing each of these partial integrals display: (1) the number of subintervals at this step, (2) the current estimate of the error ERR, (3) the current estimate for the integral Q.

     Alternatively, properties of `quadgk' can be passed to the function as pairs `"PROP", VAL'.  Valid properties are

    `AbsTol'
          Define the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The default absolute tolerance is 1e-10.

    `RelTol'
          Define the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The default relative tolerance is 1e-5.

    `MaxIntervalCount'
          `quadgk' initially subdivides the interval on which to perform the quadrature into 10 intervals.  Subintervals that have an unacceptable error are subdivided and re-evaluated.  If the number of subintervals exceeds 650 subintervals at any point then a poor convergence is signaled and the current estimate of the integral is returned.  The property "MaxIntervalCount" can be used to alter the number of subintervals that can exist before exiting.

    `WayPoints'
          Discontinuities in the first derivative of the function to integrate can be flagged with the  `"WayPoints"' property.  This forces the ends of a subinterval to fall on the breakpoints of the function and can result in significantly improved estimation of the error in the integral, faster computation, or both.  For example,

               quadgk (@(x) abs (1 - x.^2), 0, 2, "Waypoints", 1)

          signals the breakpoint in the integrand at `X = 1'.

    `Trace'
          If logically true `quadgk' prints information on the convergence of the quadrature at each iteration.

     If any of A, B, or WAYPOINTS is complex then the quadrature is treated as a contour integral along a piecewise continuous path defined by the above.  In this case the integral is assumed to have no edge singularities.  For example,

          quadgk (@(z) log (z), 1+1i, 1+1i, "WayPoints",
                  [1-1i, -1,-1i, -1+1i])

     integrates `log (z)' along the square defined by `[1+1i,  1-1i, -1-1i, -1+1i]'

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.  ERR is an approximate bound on the error in the integral `abs (Q - I)', where I is the exact value of the integral.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Both limits must be finite.

     The optional argument TOL defines the relative tolerance with which to perform the integration.  The default value is `eps'.

     The algorithm used by `quadl' involves recursively subdividing the integration interval.  If TRACE is defined then for each subinterval display: (1) the left end of the subinterval, (2) the length of the subinterval, (3) the approximation of the integral over the subinterval.

     Additional arguments P1, etc., are passed directly to the function F.  To use default values for TOL and TRACE, one may pass empty matrices ([]).

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using an adaptive Simpson's rule.  F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  `quadv' is a vectorized version of `quad' and the function defined by F must accept a scalar or vector as input and return a scalar, vector, or array as output.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Both limits must be finite.

     The optional argument TOL defines the tolerance used to stop the adaptation procedure.  The default value is 1e^-6.

     The algorithm used by `quadv' involves recursively subdividing the integration interval and applying Simpson's rule on each subinterval.  If TRACE is true then after computing each of these partial integrals display: (1) the total number of function evaluations, (2) the left end of the subinterval, (3) the length of the subinterval, (4) the approximation of the integral over the subinterval.

     Additional arguments P1, etc., are passed directly to the function F.  To use default values for TOL and TRACE, one may pass empty matrices ([]).

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.  NFUN indicates the number of function evaluations that were made.

     Note: `quadv' is written in Octave's scripting language and can be used recursively in `dblquad' and `triplequad', unlike the similar `quad' function.

     Return random integers in the range 1:IMAX.

     Additional arguments determine the shape of the return matrix.  When no arguments are specified a single random integer is returned.  If one argument N is specified then a square matrix (N x N) is returned.  Two or more arguments will return a multi-dimensional matrix (M x N x ...).

     The integer range may optionally be described by a two element matrix with a lower and upper bound in which case the returned integers will be on the interval [IMIN, IMAX].

     The optional argument "CLASS" will return a matrix of the requested type.  The default is "double".

     The following example returns 150 integers in the range 1-10.

          ri = randi (10, 150, 1)

     Implementation Note: `randi' relies internally on `rand' which uses class "double" to represent numbers.  This limits the maximum integer (IMAX) and range (IMAX - IMIN) to the value returned by the `bitmax' function.  For IEEE floating point numbers this value is 2^53 - 1.

     Return a copy of A with the elements rotated counterclockwise in 90-degree increments.  The second argument is optional, and specifies how many 90-degree rotations are to be applied (the default value is 1).  Negative values of K rotate the matrix in a clockwise direction.  For example,

          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
              =>  3  1
                  4  2

     rotates the given matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.  The following are all equivalent statements:

          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3)
          rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 7)

     Note that `rot90' only works with 2-D arrays.  To rotate N-D arrays use `rotdim' instead.

 -- Function File: B = saveobj (A)
     Method of a class to manipulate an object prior to saving it to a file.  The function `saveobj' is called when the object A is saved using the `save' function.  An example of the use of `saveobj' might be to remove fields of the object that don't make sense to be saved or it might be used to ensure that certain fields of the object are initialized before the object is saved.  For example:

          function b = saveobj (a)
            b = a;
            if (isempty (b.field))
               b.field = initfield (b);

 -- Function File: Y = shiftdim (X, N)
 -- Function File: [Y, NS] = shiftdim (X)
     Shift the dimensions of X by N, where N must be an integer scalar.  When N is positive, the dimensions of X are shifted to the left, with the leading dimensions circulated to the end.  If N is negative, then the dimensions of X are shifted to the right, with N leading singleton dimensions added.

     Called with a single argument, `shiftdim', removes the leading singleton dimensions, returning the number of dimensions removed in the second output argument NS.

     For example:

          x = ones (1, 2, 3);
          size (shiftdim (x, -1))
             => [1, 1, 2, 3]

 -- Function File:  structfun (FUNC, S)
 -- Function File: [A, ...] = structfun (...)
 -- Function File:  structfun (..., "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC)
 -- Function File:  structfun (..., "UniformOutput", VAL)
     Evaluate the function named NAME on the fields of the structure S.  The fields of S are passed to the function FUNC individually.

     `structfun' accepts an arbitrary function FUNC in the form of an inline function, function handle, or the name of a function (in a character string).  In the case of a character string argument, the function must accept a single argument named X, and it must return a string value.  If the function returns more than one argument, they are returned as separate output variables.

     If the parameter "UniformOutput" is set to true (the default), then the function must return a single element which will be concatenated into the return value.  If "UniformOutput" is false, the outputs are placed into a structure with the same fieldnames as the input structure.

          s.name1 = "John Smith";
          s.name2 = "Jill Jones";
          structfun (@(x) regexp (x, '(\w+)$', "matches"){1}, s,
                     "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
             {
               name1 = Smith
               name2 = Jones
             }

     Given the parameter "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC defines a function to call in case FUNC generates an error.  The form of the function is

          function [...] = errfunc (SE, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by SE.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message" and "index", giving respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the input arguments of the element that caused the error.  For an example on how to use an error handler, *note `cellfun': doc-cellfun.

 -- Function File: IDX = subsindex (A)
     Convert an object to an index vector.  When A is a class object defined with a class constructor, then `subsindex' is the overloading method that allows the conversion of this class object to a valid indexing vector.  It is important to note that `subsindex' must return a zero-based real integer vector of the class "double".  For example, if the class constructor

          function b = myclass (a)
            b = class (struct ("a", a), "myclass");
          endfunction

     then the `subsindex' function

          function idx = subsindex (a)
            idx = double (a.a) - 1.0;
          endfunction

     can then be used as follows

          a = myclass (1:4);
          b = 1:10;
          b(a)
          => 1  2  3  4

 -- Function File:  triplequad (F, XA, XB, YA, YB, ZA, ZB, TOL, QUADF, ...)
     Numerically evaluate the triple integral of F.  F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must have the form w = f(x,y,z) where either X or Y is a vector and the remaining inputs are scalars.  It should return a vector of the same length and orientation as X or Y.

     XA, YA, ZA and XB, YB, ZB are the lower and upper limits of integration for x, y, and z respectively.  The underlying integrator determines whether infinite bounds are accepted.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to integrate each sub-integral.  The default value is 1e^-6.

     The optional argument QUADF specifies which underlying integrator function to use.  Any choice but `quad' is available and the default is `quadcc'.

     Additional arguments, are passed directly to F.  To use the default value for TOL or QUADF one may pass ':' or an empty matrix ([]).

 -- Function File: Q = trapz (Y)
 -- Function File: Q = trapz (X, Y)
 -- Function File: Q = trapz (..., DIM)
     Numerically evaluate the integral of points Y using the trapezoidal method.  `trapz (Y)' computes the integral of Y along the first non-singleton dimension.  When the argument X is omitted an equally spaced X vector with unit spacing (1) is assumed.  `trapz (X, Y)' evaluates the integral with respect to the spacing in X and the values in Y.  This is useful if the points in Y have been sampled unevenly.  If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

     If X is not specified then unit spacing will be used.  To scale the integral to the correct value you must multiply by the actual spacing value (deltaX).  As an example, the integral of x^3 over the range [0, 1] is x^4/4 or 0.25.  The following code uses `trapz' to calculate the integral in three different ways.

          x = 0:0.1:1;
          y = x.^3;
          q = trapz (y)
            => q = 2.525   # No scaling
          q * 0.1
            => q = 0.2525  # Approximation to integral by scaling
          trapz (x, y)
            => q = 0.2525  # Same result by specifying X

     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.  The function is defined by `Y = f (X)'.  The interpolation points are all XI.

     The interpolation method can be `"nearest"' or `"linear"'.  If method is omitted it defaults to `"linear"'.

     The optional argument OPTIONS is passed directly to Qhull when computing the Delaunay triangulation used for interpolation.  See `delaunayn' for information on the defaults and how to pass different values.

 -- Function File: H = voronoi (...)
 -- Function File: [VX, VY] = voronoi (...)
     Plot the Voronoi diagram of points `(X, Y)'.  The Voronoi facets with points at infinity are not drawn.

     If "linespec" is given it is used to set the color and line style of the plot.  If an axis graphics handle HAX is supplied then the Voronoi diagram is drawn on the specified axis rather than in a new figure.

     The OPTIONS argument, which must be a string or cell array of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details `http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options'.

     If a single output argument is requested then the Voronoi diagram will be plotted and a graphics handle H to the plot is returned.  [VX, VY] = voronoi(...) returns the Voronoi vertices instead of plotting the diagram.

          x = rand (10, 1);

 -- Command:  lookfor STR
 -- Command:  lookfor -all STR
 -- Function File: [FUNC, HELPSTRING] = lookfor (STR)
 -- Function File: [FUNC, HELPSTRING] = lookfor ("-all", STR)
     Search for the string STR in all functions found in the current function search path.  By default, `lookfor' searches for STR in the first sentence of the help string of each function found.  The entire help text of each function can be searched if the "-all" argument is supplied.  All searches are case insensitive.

     Called with no output arguments, `lookfor' prints the list of matching functions to the terminal.  Otherwise, the output arguments FUNC and HELPSTRING define the matching functions and the first sentence of each of their help strings.

     The ability of `lookfor' to correctly identify the first sentence of the help text is dependent on the format of the function's help.  All Octave core functions are correctly formatted, but the same can not be guaranteed for external packages and user-supplied functions.  Therefore, the use of the "-all" argument may be necessary to find related functions that are not a part of Octave.

     Display a matrix as a color image.

     The elements of IMG are indices into the current colormap.  The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in X and Y.  If you are using gnuplot 4.1 or earlier, these variables are ignored.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

     Implementation Note: The origin (0, 0) for images is located in the upper left.  For ordinary plots, the origin is located in the lower left.  Octave handles this inversion by plotting the data normally, and then reversing the direction of the y-axis by setting the `ydir' property to "reverse".  This has implications whenever an image and an ordinary plot need to be overlaid.  The recommended solution is to display the image and then plot the reversed ydata using, for example, `flipud (ydata,1)'.

     Display a scaled version of the matrix A as a color image.  The colormap is scaled so that the entries of the matrix occupy the entire colormap.  If LIMITS = [LO, HI] are given, then that range is set to the "clim" of the current axes.

     The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in X and Y, either as pairs giving the minimum and maximum values for the respective axes, or as values for each row and column of the matrix A.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

          Endian option for formats that support it.  Is either `"little-endian"', `"big-endian"', or `"undefined"'.

    `Gamma'
          Gamma level of the image.  The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different due to differences in the display monitor.

    `Matte'
          `true' if the image has transparency.

    `ModulusDepth'
          Image modulus depth (minimum number of bits required to support red/green/blue components without loss of accuracy).

    `Quality'
          JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.

    `QuantizeColors'
          Preferred number of colors in the image.

    `ResolutionUnits'

 -- Function File: [IMG, MAP, ALPHA] = imread (FILENAME)
     Read images from various file formats.

     The size and numeric class of the output depends on the format of the image.  A color image is returned as an MxNx3 matrix.  Gray-level and black-and-white images are of size MxN.  The color depth of the image determines the numeric class of the output: "uint8" or "uint16" for gray and color, and "logical" for black and white.

     Display the image IM, where IM can be a 2-dimensional (gray-scale image) or a 3-dimensional (RGB image) matrix.

     If LIMITS is a 2-element vector `[LOW, HIGH]', the image is shown using a display range between LOW and HIGH.  If an empty matrix is passed for LIMITS, the display range is computed as the range between the minimal and the maximal value in the image.

     If MAP is a valid color map, the image will be shown as an indexed image using the supplied color map.

     If a file name is given instead of an image, the file will be read and shown.

     If given, the parameter STRING_PARAM1 has value VALUE1.  STRING_PARAM1 can be any of the following:

    "displayrange"
          VALUE1 is the display range as described above.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

 -- Function File: [A, ...] = strread (STR, FORMAT, FORMAT_REPEAT, PROP1, VALUE1, ...)
     Read data from a string.

     The string STR is split into words that are repeatedly matched to the specifiers in FORMAT.  The first word is matched to the first specifier, the second to the second specifier and so forth.  If there are more words than specifiers, the process is repeated until all words have been processed.

     The string FORMAT describes how the words in STR should be parsed.  It may contain any combination of the following specifiers:

    `%s'
          The word is parsed as a string.

    `%f'
    `%n'
          The word is parsed as a number and converted to double.

    `%d'
    `%u'
          The word is parsed as a number and converted to int32.

    `%*', '%*f', '%*s'
          The word is skipped.

          For %s and %d, %f, %n, %u and the associated %*s ... specifiers an optional width can be specified as %Ns, etc. where N is an integer > 1.  For %f, format specifiers like %N.Mf are allowed.

    `literals'
          In addition the format may contain literal character strings; these will be skipped during reading.

     Parsed word corresponding to the first specifier are returned in the first output argument and likewise for the rest of the specifiers.

     By default, FORMAT is "%f", meaning that numbers are read from STR.  This will do if STR contains only numeric fields.

     For example, the string

          STR = "\
          Bunny Bugs   5.5\n\
          Duck Daffy  -7.5e-5\n\
          Penguin Tux   6"

     can be read using

          [A, B, C] = strread (STR, "%s %s %f");

     Optional numeric argument FORMAT_REPEAT can be used for limiting the number of items read:

    -1
          (default) read all of the string until the end.

    N
          Read N times NARGOUT items.  0 (zero) is an acceptable value for FORMAT_REPEAT.

     The behavior of `strread' can be changed via property-value pairs.  The following properties are recognized:

    "commentstyle"
          Parts of STR are considered comments and will be skipped.  VALUE is the comment style and can be any of the following.

             * "shell" Everything from `#' characters to the nearest end-of-line is skipped.

             * "c" Everything between `/*' and `*/' is skipped.

             * "c++" Everything from `//' characters to the nearest end-of-line is skipped.

             * "matlab" Everything from `%' characters to the nearest end-of-line is skipped.

             * user-supplied.  Two options: (1) One string, or 1x1 cell string: Skip everything to the right of it; (2) 2x1 cell string array: Everything between the left and right strings is skipped.

    "delimiter"
          Any character in VALUE will be used to split STR into words (default value = any whitespace).

    "emptyvalue":
          Value to return for empty numeric values in non-whitespace delimited data.  The default is NaN.  When the data type does not support NaN (int32 for example), then default is zero.

    "multipledelimsasone"
          Treat a series of consecutive delimiters, without whitespace in between, as a single delimiter.  Consecutive delimiter series need not be vertically "aligned".

    "treatasempty"
          Treat single occurrences (surrounded by delimiters or whitespace) of the string(s) in VALUE as missing values.

    "returnonerror"
          If VALUE true (1, default), ignore read errors and return normally.  If false (0), return an error.

    "whitespace"
          Any character in VALUE will be interpreted as whitespace and trimmed; the string defining whitespace must be enclosed in double quotes for proper processing of special characters like \t.  The default value for whitespace = " \b\r\n\t" (note the space).  Unless whitespace is set to " (empty) AND at least one "%s" format conversion specifier is supplied, a space is always part of whitespace.

 -- Function File: C = textscan (STR, ...)
 -- Function File: [C, POSITION] = textscan (FID, ...)
     Read data from a text file or string.

     The file associated with FID is read and parsed according to FORMAT.  The function behaves like `strread' except it works by parsing a file instead of a string.  See the documentation of `strread' for details.

     In addition to the options supported by `strread', this function supports a few more:

        * "collectoutput": A value of 1 or true instructs textscan to concatenate consecutive columns of the same class in the output cell array.  A value of 0 or false (default) leaves output in distinct columns.

        * "endofline": Specify "\r", "\n" or "\r\n" (for CR, LF, or CRLF).  If no value is given, it will be inferred from the file.  If set to "" (empty string) EOLs are ignored as delimiters and added to whitespace.

        * "headerlines": The first VALUE number of lines of FID are skipped.

        * "returnonerror": If set to numerical 1 or true (default), return normally when read errors have been encountered.  If set to 0 or false, return an error and no data.

     When reading from a character string, optional input argument N specifies the number of times FORMAT should be used (i.e., to limit the amount of data read).  When reading fro file, N specifies the number of data lines to read; in this sense it differs slightly from the format repeat count in strread.

     The output C is a cell array whose length is given by the number of format specifiers.

     The second output, POSITION, provides the position, in characters, from the beginning of the file.

     Compute the P-norm condition number of a matrix.

     `cond (A)' is ## defined as `norm (A, P) * norm (inv (A), P)'.

     By default `P = 2' is used which implies a (relatively slow) singular value decomposition.  Other possible selections are `P = 1, Inf, "fro"' which are generally faster.  See `norm' for a full discussion of possible P values.

 -- Function File: [EST, V] = condest (A, SOLVE, SOLVE_T, T)
 -- Function File: [EST, V] = condest (APPLY, APPLY_T, SOLVE, SOLVE_T, N, T)
     Estimate the 1-norm condition number of a matrix A using T test vectors using a randomized 1-norm estimator.  If T exceeds 5, then only 5 test vectors are used.

     If the matrix is not explicit, e.g., when estimating the condition number of A given an LU factorization, `condest' uses the following functions:

    APPLY
          `A*x' for a matrix `x' of size N by T.

    APPLY_T
          `A'*x' for a matrix `x' of size N by T.

    SOLVE
          `A \ b' for a matrix `b' of size N by T.

    SOLVE_T
          `A' \ b' for a matrix `b' of size N by T.

     The implicit version requires an explicit dimension N.

     `condest' uses a randomized algorithm to approximate the 1-norms.

     `condest' returns the 1-norm condition estimate EST and a vector V satisfying `norm (A*v, 1) == norm (A, 1) * norm (V, 1) / EST'.  When EST is large, V is an approximate null vector.

     Return the exponential of a matrix, defined as the infinite Taylor series

     The Taylor series is _not_ the way to compute the matrix exponential; see Moler and Van Loan, `Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix', SIAM Review, 1978.  This routine uses Ward's diagonal Pade' approximation method with three step preconditioning (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 1977).  Diagonal Pade' approximations are rational polynomials of matrices

               -1
          D (A)   N (A)

     whose Taylor series matches the first `2q+1' terms of the Taylor series above; direct evaluation of the Taylor series (with the same preconditioning steps) may be desirable in lieu of the Pade' approximation when `Dq(A)' is ill-conditioned.

     Construct an orthogonal basis U of block Krylov subspace

          [v a*v a^2*v ... a^(k+1)*v]

     Using Householder reflections to guard against loss of orthogonality.

     If V is a vector, then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that a*u == u*h+rk*ek', in which `rk = a*u(:,k)-u*h(:,k)', and ek' is the vector `[0, 0, ..., 1]' of length `k'.  Otherwise, H is meaningless.

     If V is a vector and K is greater than `length(A)-1', then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that `a*u == u*h'.

     The value of NU is the dimension of the span of the Krylov subspace (based on EPS1).

     If B is a vector and K is greater than M-1, then H contains the Hessenberg decomposition of A.

     The optional parameter EPS1 is the threshold for zero.  The default value is 1e-12.

     If the optional parameter PFLG is nonzero, row pivoting is used to improve numerical behavior.  The default value is 0.

 -- Function File:  compare_versions (V1, V2, OPERATOR)
     Compare two version strings using the given OPERATOR.

     This function assumes that versions V1 and V2 are arbitrarily long strings made of numeric and period characters possibly followed by an arbitrary string (e.g., "1.2.3", "0.3", "0.1.2+", or "1.2.3.4-test1").

     The version is first split into numeric and character portions and then the parts are padded to be the same length (i.e., "1.1" would be padded to be "1.1.0" when being compared with "1.1.1", and separately, the character parts of the strings are padded with nulls).

     The operator can be any logical operator from the set

        * "==" equal

        * "<" less than

        * "<=" less than or equal to

        * ">" greater than

        * ">=" greater than or equal to

        * "!=" not equal

        * "~=" not equal

     Note that version "1.1-test2" will compare as greater than "1.1-test10".  Also, since the numeric part is compared first, "a" compares less than "1a" because the second string starts with a numeric part even though `double("a")' is greater than `double("1").'

     Summary of debugging commands.  For more information on each command and available options use `help CMD'.

     The debugging commands available in Octave are

    `dbstop'
          Add a breakpoint.

    `dbclear'
          Remove a breakpoint.

    `dbstatus'
          List all breakpoints.

    `dbwhere'
          Report the current file and line number where execution is stopped.

    `dbtype'
          List the function where execution is currently stopped, enumerating the line numbers.

    `dbstep'
    `dbnext'
          Execute (step) one or more lines, follow execution into (step into) a function call, or execute until the end of a function (step out), and re-enter debug mode.

    `dbcont'
          Continue normal code execution from the debug prompt.

    `dbquit'
          Quit debugging mode immediately and return to the main prompt.

    `dbstack'
          Print a backtrace of the execution stack.

    `dbup'
          Move up the execution stack.

    `dbdown'
          Move down the execution stack.

    `keyboard'
          Force entry into debug mode from an m-file.

    `debug_on_error'
          Configure whether Octave enters debug mode when it encounters an error.

    `debug_on_warning'
          Configure whether Octave enters debug mode when it encounters a warning.

    `debug_on_interrupt'
          Configure whether Octave enters debug mode when it encounters an interrupt.

    `isdebugmode'
          Return true if in debug mode.

     When Octave encounters a breakpoint, or other reason to enter debug mode, the prompt changes to `"debug>"'.  The workspace of the function where the breakpoint was encountered becomes available and any Octave command that is valid in that workspace context may be executed.

edit

# elements: 1

 -- Command:  edit NAME
 -- Command:  edit FIELD VALUE
 -- Command: VALUE = edit get FIELD
     Edit the named function, or change editor settings.

     If `edit' is called with the name of a file or function as its argument it will be opened in a text editor.

        * If the function NAME is available in a file on your path and that file is modifiable, then it will be edited in place.  If it is a system function, then it will first be copied to the directory `HOME' (see further down) and then edited.  If no file is found, then the m-file variant, ending with ".m", will be considered.  If still no file is found, then variants with a leading "@" and then with both a leading "@" and trailing ".m" will be considered.

        * If NAME is the name of a function defined in the interpreter but not in an m-file, then an m-file will be created in `HOME' to contain that function along with its current definition.

        * If `name.cc' is specified, then it will search for `name.cc' in the path and try to modify it, otherwise it will create a new `.cc' file in `HOME'.  If NAME happens to be an m-file or interpreter defined function, then the text of that function will be inserted into the .cc file as a comment.

        * If NAME.EXT is on your path then it will be edited, otherwise the editor will be started with `HOME/name.ext' as the filename.  If `name.ext' is not modifiable, it will be copied to `HOME' before editing.

          *Warning:* You may need to clear name before the new definition is available.  If you are editing a .cc file, you will need to mkoctfile `name.cc' before the definition will be available.

     If `edit' is called with FIELD and VALUE variables, the value of the control field FIELD will be VALUE.  If an output argument is requested and the first argument is `get' then `edit' will return the value of the control field FIELD.  If the control field does not exist, edit will return a structure containing all fields and values.  Thus, `edit get all' returns a complete control structure.  The following control fields are used:

    `editor'
          This is the editor to use to modify the functions.  By default it uses Octave's `EDITOR' built-in function, which comes from `getenv("EDITOR")' and defaults to `emacs'.  Use `%s' In place of the function name.  For example,

         `[EDITOR, " %s"]'
               Use the editor which Octave uses for `edit_history'.

         `"xedit %s &"'
               pop up simple X11 editor in a separate window

         `"gnudoit -q \"(find-file \\\"%s\\\")\""'
               Send it to current Emacs; must have `(gnuserv-start)' in `.emacs'.

          See also field 'mode', which controls how the editor is run by Octave.

          On Cygwin, you will need to convert the Cygwin path to a Windows path if you are using a native Windows editor.  For example:

          '"C:/Program Files/Good Editor/Editor.exe" "$(cygpath -wa %s)"'


    `home'
          This is the location of user local m-files.  Be be sure it is in your path.  The default is `~/octave'.

    `author'
          This is the name to put after the "## Author:" field of new functions.  By default it guesses from the `gecos' field of password database.

    `email'
          This is the e-mail address to list after the name in the author field.  By default it guesses `<$LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME>', and if `$HOSTNAME' is not defined it uses `uname -n'.  You probably want to override this.  Be sure to use `<user@host>' as your format.

    `license'

         `gpl'
               GNU General Public License (default).

         `bsd'
               BSD-style license without advertising clause.

         `pd'
               Public domain.

         `"text"'
               Your own default copyright and license.

          Unless you specify `pd', edit will prepend the copyright statement with "Copyright (C) yyyy Function Author".

    `mode'
          This value determines whether the editor should be started in async mode (editor is started in the background and Octave continues) or sync mode (Octave waits until the editor exits).  Set it to "sync" to start the editor in sync mode.  The default is "async" (see also "system").

    `editinplace'
          Determines whether files should be edited in place, without regard to whether they are modifiable or not.  The default is `false'.

 -- Command:  mkoctfile [-options] file ...
 -- Function File: [OUTPUT, STATUS = mkoctfile (...)
     The `mkoctfile' function compiles source code written in C, C++, or Fortran.  Depending on the options used with `mkoctfile', the compiled code can be called within Octave or can be used as a stand-alone application.

     `mkoctfile' can be called from the shell prompt or from the Octave prompt.  Calling it from the Octave prompt simply delegates the call to the shell prompt.  The output is stored in the OUTPUT variable and the exit status in the STATUS variable.

     `mkoctfile' accepts the following options, all of which are optional except for the file name of the code you wish to compile:

    `-I DIR'
          Add the include directory DIR to compile commands.

    `-D DEF'
          Add the definition DEF to the compiler call.

    `-l LIB'
          Add the library LIB to the link command.

    `-L DIR'
          Add the library directory DIR to the link command.

    `-M'
    `--depend'
          Generate dependency files (.d) for C and C++ source files.

    `-R DIR'
          Add the run-time path to the link command.

    `-Wl,...'
          Pass flags though the linker like "-Wl,-rpath=...".  The quotes are needed since commas are interpreted as command separators.

    `-W...'
          Pass flags though the compiler like "-Wa,OPTION".

    `-c'
          Compile but do not link.

    `-g'
          Enable debugging options for compilers.

    `-o FILE'
    `--output FILE'
          Output file name.  Default extension is .oct (or .mex if `--mex' is specified) unless linking a stand-alone executable.

    `-p VAR'
    `--print VAR'
          Print the configuration variable VAR.  Recognized variables are:

 -- Function File: [T, P] = orderfields (S1)
 -- Function File: [T, P] = orderfields (S1, S2)
     Return a copy of S1 with fields arranged alphabetically or as specified by S2.

     Given one struct, arrange field names in S1 alphabetically.

     If the second argument is a struct, arrange field names in S1 as they appear in S2.  The second argument may also specify the order in a permutation vector or a cell array of strings containing the fieldnames of S1 in the desired order.

     The optional second output argument P is assigned the permutation vector which converts the original name order into the new name order.

     Examples:

          s = struct("d", 4, "b", 2, "a", 1, "c", 3);
          t1 = orderfields (s)
               => t1 =

 -- Function File: [REG, PROP] = parseparams (PARAMS)
 -- Function File: [REG, VAR1, ...] = parseparams (PARAMS, NAME1, DEFAULT1, ...)
     Return in REG the cell elements of PARAM up to the first string element and in PROP all remaining elements beginning with the first string element.  For example:

          [reg, prop] = parseparams ({1, 2, "linewidth", 10})
          reg =
          {
            [1,1] = 1
            [1,2] = 2
          }
          prop =

            [1,1] = linewidth
            [1,2] = 10
          }

     The parseparams function may be used to separate "regular" arguments and additional arguments given as property/value pairs of the VARARGIN cell array.

     In the second form of the call, available options are specified directly with their default values given as name-value pairs.  If PARAMS do not form name-value pairs, or if an option occurs that does not match any of the available options, an error occurs.  When called from an m-file function, the error is prefixed with the name of the caller function.  The matching of options is case-insensitive.

 -- Function File: [K1, ..., V1] = setfield (S, K1, V1, ...)
     Set a field member in a (nested) structure array.  For example:

          oo(1,1).f0 = 1;
          oo = setfield (oo, {1,2}, "fd", {3}, "b", 6);
          oo(1,2).fd(3).b == 6
               => ans = 1

     Note that the same result as in the above example could be achieved by:

          i1 = {1,2}; i2 = "fd"; i3 = {3}; i4 = "b";
          oo(i1{:}).(i2)(i3{:}).(i4) == 6

`Octave:abbreviated-property-match'
     By default, the `Octave:abbreviated-property-match' warning is enabled.

`Octave:array-to-scalar'
     If the `Octave:array-to-scalar' warning is enabled, Octave will warn when an implicit conversion from an array to a scalar value is attempted.  By default, the `Octave:array-to-scalar' warning is disabled.

`Octave:array-to-vector'
     If the `Octave:array-to-vector' warning is enabled, Octave will warn when an implicit conversion from an array to a vector value is attempted.  By default, the `Octave:array-to-vector' warning is disabled.

`Octave:assign-as-truth-value'
     If the `Octave:assign-as-truth-value' warning is enabled, a warning is issued for statements like

          if (s = t)
            ...

     since such statements are not common, and it is likely that the intent was to write

          if (s == t)
            ...

     instead.

     There are times when it is useful to write code that contains assignments within the condition of a `while' or `if' statement.  For example, statements like

          while (c = getc ())
            ...

     are common in C programming.

     It is possible to avoid all warnings about such statements by disabling the `Octave:assign-as-truth-value' warning, but that may also let real errors like

          if (x = 1)  # intended to test (x == 1)!
            ...

     slip by.

     In such cases, it is possible suppress errors for specific statements by writing them with an extra set of parentheses.  For example, writing the previous example as

          while ((c = getc ()))
            ...

     will prevent the warning from being printed for this statement, while allowing Octave to warn about other assignments used in conditional contexts.

     By default, the `Octave:assign-as-truth-value' warning is enabled.

`Octave:associativity-change'
     If the `Octave:associativity-change' warning is enabled, Octave will warn about possible changes in the meaning of some code due to changes in associativity for some operators.  Associativity changes have typically been made for MATLAB compatibility.  By default, the `Octave:associativity-change' warning is enabled.

`Octave:autoload-relative-file-name'
     If the `Octave:autoload-relative-file-name' is enabled, Octave will warn when parsing autoload() function calls with relative paths to function files.  This usually happens when using autoload() calls in PKG_ADD files, when the PKG_ADD file is not in the same directory as the .oct file referred to by the autoload() command.  By default, the `Octave:autoload-relative-file-name' warning is enabled.

`Octave:broadcast'
     Warn when performing broadcasting operations.  By default, this is enabled.  See *note Broadcasting:: in the chapter Vectorization and Faster Code Execution of the manual.

`Octave:built-in-variable-assignment'
     By default, the `Octave:built-in-variable-assignment' warning is enabled.

`Octave:divide-by-zero'
     If the `Octave:divide-by-zero' warning is enabled, a warning is issued when Octave encounters a division by zero.  By default, the `Octave:divide-by-zero' warning is enabled.

`Octave:fopen-file-in-path'
     By default, the `Octave:fopen-file-in-path' warning is enabled.

`Octave:function-name-clash'
     If the `Octave:function-name-clash' warning is enabled, a warning is issued when Octave finds that the name of a function defined in a function file differs from the name of the file.  (If the names disagree, the name declared inside the file is ignored.)  By default, the `Octave:function-name-clash' warning is enabled.

`Octave:future-time-stamp'
     If the `Octave:future-time-stamp' warning is enabled, Octave will print a warning if it finds a function file with a time stamp that is in the future.  By default, the `Octave:future-time-stamp' warning is enabled.

`Octave:glyph-render'
     By default, the `Octave:glyph-render' warning is enabled.

`Octave:imag-to-real'
     If the `Octave:imag-to-real' warning is enabled, a warning is printed for implicit conversions of complex numbers to real numbers.  By default, the `Octave:imag-to-real' warning is disabled.

`Octave:load-file-in-path'
     By default, the `Octave:load-file-in-path' warning is enabled.

`Octave:logical-conversion'
     By default, the `Octave:logical-conversion' warning is enabled.

`Octave:matlab-incompatible'
     Print warnings for Octave language features that may cause compatibility problems with MATLAB.  By default, the `Octave:matlab-incompatible' warning is disabled.

`Octave:md5sum-file-in-path'
     By default, the `Octave:md5sum-file-in-path' warning is enabled.

`Octave:missing-glyph'
     By default, the `Octave:missing-glyph' warning is enabled.

`Octave:missing-semicolon'
     If the `Octave:missing-semicolon' warning is enabled, Octave will warn when statements in function definitions don't end in semicolons.  By default the `Octave:missing-semicolon' warning is disabled.

`Octave:mixed-string-concat'
     If the `Octave:mixed-string-concat' warning is enabled, print a warning when concatenating a mixture of double and single quoted strings.  By default, the `Octave:mixed-string-concat' warning is disabled.

`Octave:neg-dim-as-zero'
     If the `Octave:neg-dim-as-zero' warning is enabled, print a warning for expressions like

          eye (-1)

     By default, the `Octave:neg-dim-as-zero' warning is disabled.

`Octave:nested-functions-coerced'
     By default, the `Octave:nested-functions-coerced' warning is enabled.

`Octave:noninteger-range-as-index'
     By default, the `Octave:noninteger-range-as-index' warning is enabled.

`Octave:num-to-str'
     If the `Octave:num-to-str' warning is enable, a warning is printed for implicit conversions of numbers to their ASCII character equivalents when strings are constructed using a mixture of strings and numbers in matrix notation.  For example,

          [ "f", 111, 111 ]
          => "foo"

     elicits a warning if the `Octave:num-to-str' warning is enabled.  By default, the `Octave:num-to-str' warning is enabled.

`Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator'
     If the `Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator' warning is enabled, Octave will warn about using the not short circuiting operators `&' and `|' inside `if' or `while' conditions.  They normally never short circuit, but MATLAB always short circuits if any logical operators are used in a condition.  You can turn on the option

          do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation (1)

     if you would like to enable this short-circuit evaluation in Octave.  Note that the `&&' and `||' operators always short circuit in both Octave and MATLAB, so it's only necessary to enable MATLAB-style short-circuiting it's too arduous to modify existing code that relies on this behavior.  By default, the `Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator' warning is enabled.

`Octave:precedence-change'
     If the `Octave:precedence-change' warning is enabled, Octave will warn about possible changes in the meaning of some code due to changes in precedence for some operators.  Precedence changes have typically been made for MATLAB compatibility.  By default, the `Octave:precedence-change' warning is enabled.

`Octave:recursive-path-search'
     By default, the `Octave:recursive-path-search' warning is enabled.

`Octave:reload-forces-clear'
     If several functions have been loaded from the same file, Octave must clear all the functions before any one of them can be reloaded.  If the `Octave:reload-forces-clear' warning is enabled, Octave will warn you when this happens, and print a list of the additional functions that it is forced to clear.  By default, the `Octave:reload-forces-clear' warning is enabled.

`Octave:resize-on-range-error'
     If the `Octave:resize-on-range-error' warning is enabled, print a warning when a matrix is resized by an indexed assignment with indices outside the current bounds.  By default, the ## `Octave:resize-on-range-error' warning is disabled.

`Octave:separator-insert'
     Print warning if commas or semicolons might be inserted automatically in literal matrices.  By default, the `Octave:separator-insert' warning is disabled.

`Octave:shadowed-function'
     By default, the `Octave:shadowed-function' warning is enabled.

`Octave:single-quote-string'
     Print warning if a single quote character is used to introduce a string constant.  By default, the `Octave:single-quote-string' warning is disabled.

`Octave:singular-matrix-div'
     By default, the `Octave:singular-matrix-div' warning is enabled.

`Octave:sqrtm:SingularMatrix'
     By default, the `Octave:sqrtm:SingularMatrix' warning is enabled.

`Octave:str-to-num'
     If the `Octave:str-to-num' warning is enabled, a warning is printed for implicit conversions of strings to their numeric ASCII equivalents.  For example,

          "abc" + 0
          => 97 98 99

     elicits a warning if the `Octave:str-to-num' warning is enabled.  By default, the `Octave:str-to-num' warning is disabled.

`Octave:undefined-return-values'
     If the `Octave:undefined-return-values' warning is disabled, print a warning if a function does not define all the values in the return list which are expected.  By default, the `Octave:undefined-return-values' warning is enabled.

`Octave:variable-switch-label'
     If the `Octave:variable-switch-label' warning is enabled, Octave will print a warning if a switch label is not a constant or constant expression.  By default, the `Octave:variable-switch-label' warning is disabled.

 -- Function File: [X, FVEC, INFO, OUTPUT, GRAD, HESS] = fminunc (FCN, ...)
     Solve an unconstrained optimization problem defined by the function FCN.  FCN should accepts a vector (array) defining the unknown variables, and return the objective function value, optionally with gradient.  In other words, this function attempts to determine a vector X such that `FCN (X)' is a local minimum.  X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise is treated as a column vector.  OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, `fminunc' recognizes these options: `"FunValCheck"', `"OutputFcn"', `"TolX"', `"TolFun"', `"MaxIter"', `"MaxFunEvals"', `"GradObj"', `"FinDiffType"', `"TypicalX"', `"AutoScaling"'.

     If `"GradObj"' is `"on"', it specifies that FCN, called with 2 output arguments, also returns the Jacobian matrix of right-hand sides at the requested point.  `"TolX"' specifies the termination tolerance in the unknown variables, while `"TolFun"' is a tolerance for equations.  Default is `1e-7' for both `"TolX"' and `"TolFun"'.

     For description of the other options, see `optimset'.

     On return, FVAL contains the value of the function FCN evaluated at X, and INFO may be one of the following values:

    1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative gradient error is less than specified by TolFun.

    2
          Last relative step size was less that TolX.

    3
          Last relative decrease in function value was less than TolF.

    0
          Iteration limit exceeded.

    -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Optionally, fminunc can also yield a structure with convergence statistics (OUTPUT), the output gradient (GRAD) and approximate Hessian (HESS).

     Note: If you only have a single nonlinear equation of one variable, using `fminbnd' is usually a much better idea.

 -- Function File:  fsolve (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVEC, INFO, OUTPUT, FJAC] = fsolve (FCN, ...)
     Solve a system of nonlinear equations defined by the function FCN.  FCN should accept a vector (array) defining the unknown variables, and return a vector of left-hand sides of the equations.  Right-hand sides are defined to be zeros.  In other words, this function attempts to determine a vector X such that `FCN (X)' gives (approximately) all zeros.  X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise it is treated as a column vector.  OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, `fsolve' recognizes these options: `"FunValCheck"', `"OutputFcn"', `"TolX"', `"TolFun"', `"MaxIter"', `"MaxFunEvals"', `"Jacobian"', `"Updating"', `"ComplexEqn"' `"TypicalX"', `"AutoScaling"' and `"FinDiffType"'.

     If `"Jacobian"' is `"on"', it specifies that FCN, called with 2 output arguments, also returns the Jacobian matrix of right-hand sides at the requested point.  `"TolX"' specifies the termination tolerance in the unknown variables, while `"TolFun"' is a tolerance for equations.  Default is `1e-7' for both `"TolX"' and `"TolFun"'.

     If `"AutoScaling"' is on, the variables will be automatically scaled according to the column norms of the (estimated) Jacobian.  As a result, TolF becomes scaling-independent.  By default, this option is off, because it may sometimes deliver unexpected (though mathematically correct) results.

     If `"Updating"' is "on", the function will attempt to use Broyden updates to update the Jacobian, in order to reduce the amount of Jacobian calculations.  If your user function always calculates the Jacobian (regardless of number of output arguments), this option provides no advantage and should be set to false.

     `"ComplexEqn"' is `"on"', `fsolve' will attempt to solve complex equations in complex variables, assuming that the equations possess a complex derivative (i.e., are holomorphic).  If this is not what you want, should unpack the real and imaginary parts of the system to get a real system.

     For description of the other options, see `optimset'.

     On return, FVAL contains the value of the function FCN evaluated at X, and INFO may be one of the following values:

    1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative residual error is less than specified by TolFun.

    2
          Last relative step size was less that TolX.

    3
          Last relative decrease in residual was less than TolF.

    0
          Iteration limit exceeded.

    -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Note: If you only have a single nonlinear equation of one variable, using `fzero' is usually a much better idea.

     Note about user-supplied Jacobians: As an inherent property of the algorithm, Jacobian is always requested for a solution vector whose residual vector is already known, and it is the last accepted successful step.  Often this will be one of the last two calls, but not always.  If the savings by reusing intermediate results from residual calculation in Jacobian calculation are significant, the best strategy is to employ OutputFcn: After a vector is evaluated for residuals, if OutputFcn is called with that vector, then the intermediate results should be saved for future Jacobian evaluation, and should be kept until a Jacobian evaluation is requested or until outputfcn is called with a different vector, in which case they should be dropped in favor of this most recent vector.  A short example how this can be achieved follows:

          function [fvec, fjac] = user_func (x, optimvalues, state)
          persistent sav = [], sav0 = [];
          if (nargin == 1)
            ## evaluation call
            if (nargout == 1)
              sav0.x = x; # mark saved vector
              ## calculate fvec, save results to sav0.
            elseif (nargout == 2)
              ## calculate fjac using sav.
            endif
          else
            ## outputfcn call.
            if (all (x == sav0.x))
              sav = sav0;
            endif
            ## maybe output iteration status, etc.
          endif
          endfunction

          ## ...

          fsolve (@user_func, x0, optimset ("OutputFcn", @user_func, ...))

 -- Function File:  fzero (FUN, X0)
 -- Function File:  fzero (FUN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT] = fzero (...)
     Find a zero of a univariate function.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  X0 should be a two-element vector specifying two points which bracket a zero.  In other words, there must be a change in sign of the function between X0(1) and X0(2).  More mathematically, the following must hold

          sign (FUN(X0(1))) * sign (FUN(X0(2))) <= 0

     If X0 is a single scalar then several nearby and distant values are probed in an attempt to obtain a valid bracketing.  If this is not successful, the function fails.  OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, `fzero' recognizes these options: `"FunValCheck"', `"OutputFcn"', `"TolX"', `"MaxIter"', `"MaxFunEvals"'.  For a description of these options, see *note optimset: doc-optimset.

     On exit, the function returns X, the approximate zero point and FVAL, the function value thereof.  INFO is an exit flag that can have these values:

        * 1  The algorithm converged to a solution.

        * 0  Maximum number of iterations or function evaluations has been reached.

        * -1 The algorithm has been terminated from user output function.

        * -5 The algorithm may have converged to a singular point.

     OUTPUT is a structure containing runtime information about the `fzero' algorithm.  Fields in the structure are:

        * iterations  Number of iterations through loop.

        * nfev  Number of function evaluations.

        * bracketx  A two-element vector with the final bracketing of the zero along the x-axis.

        * brackety  A two-element vector with the final bracketing of the zero along the y-axis.

                    Report all primal and dual values "as is".

              1
                    Replace tiny primal and dual values by exact zero.

         `itlim   (`LPX_K_ITLIM', default: -1)'
               Simplex iterations limit.  If this value is positive, it is decreased by one each time when one simplex iteration has been performed, and reaching zero value signals the solver to stop the search.  Negative value means no iterations limit.

         `itcnt (`LPX_K_OUTFRQ', default: 200)'
               Output frequency, in iterations.  This parameter specifies how frequently the solver sends information about the solution to the standard output.

         `branch (`LPX_K_BRANCH', default: 2)'
               Branching heuristic option (for MIP only):

              0
                    Branch on the first variable.

              1
                    Branch on the last variable.

                    Branch using a heuristic by Driebeck and Tomlin.

         `btrack (`LPX_K_BTRACK', default: 2)'
               Backtracking heuristic option (for MIP only):

              0
                    Depth first search.

              1
                    Breadth first search.

              2
                    Backtrack using the best projection heuristic.

         `presol (`LPX_K_PRESOL', default: 1)'
               If this flag is set, the routine lpx_simplex solves the problem using the built-in LP presolver.  Otherwise the LP presolver is not used.

         `lpsolver (default: 1)'
               Select which solver to use.  If the problem is a MIP problem this flag will be ignored.

              1
                    Revised simplex method.

              2
                    Interior point method.

         `save (default: 0)'
               If this parameter is nonzero, save a copy of the problem in CPLEX LP format to the file `"outpb.lp"'.  There is currently no way to change the name of the output file.

          Real parameters:

         `relax (`LPX_K_RELAX', default: 0.07)'
               Relaxation parameter used in the ratio test.  If it is zero, the textbook ratio test is used.  If it is non-zero (should be positive), Harris' two-pass ratio test is used.  In the latter case on the first pass of the ratio test basic variables (in the case of primal simplex) or reduced costs of non-basic variables (in the case of dual simplex) are allowed to slightly violate their bounds, but not more than `relax*tolbnd' or `relax*toldj (thus, `relax' is a percentage of `tolbnd' or `toldj''.

         `tolbnd (`LPX_K_TOLBND', default: 10e-7)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic solution is primal feasible.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `toldj (`LPX_K_TOLDJ', default: 10e-7)'
               Absolute tolerance used to check if the current basic solution is dual feasible.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `tolpiv (`LPX_K_TOLPIV', default: 10e-9)'
               Relative tolerance used to choose eligible pivotal elements of the simplex table.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `objll (`LPX_K_OBJLL', default: -DBL_MAX)'
               Lower limit of the objective function.  If on the phase II the objective function reaches this limit and continues decreasing, the solver stops the search.  This parameter is used in the dual simplex method only.

         `objul (`LPX_K_OBJUL', default: +DBL_MAX)'
               Upper limit of the objective function.  If on the phase II the objective function reaches this limit and continues increasing, the solver stops the search.  This parameter is used in the dual simplex only.

         `tmlim (`LPX_K_TMLIM', default: -1.0)'
               Searching time limit, in seconds.  If this value is positive, it is decreased each time when one simplex iteration has been performed by the amount of time spent for the iteration, and reaching zero value signals the solver to stop the search.  Negative value means no time limit.

         `outdly (`LPX_K_OUTDLY', default: 0.0)'
               Output delay, in seconds.  This parameter specifies how long the solver should delay sending information about the solution to the standard output.  Non-positive value means no delay.

         `tolint (`LPX_K_TOLINT', default: 10e-5)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic solution is integer feasible.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `tolobj (`LPX_K_TOLOBJ', default: 10e-7)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the value of the objective function is not better than in the best known integer feasible solution.  It is not recommended that you change this parameter unless you have a detailed understanding of its purpose.

     subject to

          g(x)  = 0
          h(x) >= 0
          lb <= x <= ub

     using a sequential quadratic programming method.

     The first argument is the initial guess for the vector X0.

     The second argument is a function handle pointing to the objective function PHI.  The objective function must accept one vector argument and return a scalar.

     The second argument may also be a 2- or 3-element cell array of function handles.  The first element should point to the objective function, the second should point to a function that computes the gradient of the objective function, and the third should point to a function that computes the Hessian of the objective function.  If the gradient function is not supplied, the gradient is computed by finite differences.  If the Hessian function is not supplied, a BFGS update formula is used to approximate the Hessian.

     When supplied, the gradient function `PHI{2}' must accept one vector argument and return a vector.  When supplied, the Hessian function `PHI{3}' must accept one vector argument and return a matrix.

     The third and fourth arguments G and H are function handles pointing to functions that compute the equality constraints and the inequality constraints, respectively.  If the problem does not have equality (or inequality) constraints, then use an empty matrix ([]) for G (or H).  When supplied, these equality and inequality constraint functions must accept one vector argument and return a vector.

     The third and fourth arguments may also be 2-element cell arrays of function handles.  The first element should point to the constraint function and the second should point to a function that computes the gradient of the constraint function:

                      [ d f(x)   d f(x)        d f(x) ]
          transpose ( [ ------   -----   ...   ------ ] )
                      [  dx_1     dx_2          dx_N  ]

     The fifth and sixth arguments, LB and UB, contain lower and upper bounds on X.  These must be consistent with the equality and inequality constraints G and H.  If the arguments are vectors then X(i) is bound by LB(i) and UB(i).  A bound can also be a scalar in which case all elements of X will share the same bound.  If only one bound (lb, ub) is specified then the other will default to (-REALMAX, +REALMAX).

     The seventh argument MAXITER specifies the maximum number of iterations.  The default value is 100.

     The eighth argument TOL specifies the tolerance for the stopping criteria.  The default value is `sqrt(eps)'.

     The value returned in INFO may be one of the following:

    101
          The algorithm terminated normally.  Either all constraints meet the requested tolerance, or the stepsize, delta X, is less than `TOL * norm (x)'.

    102
          The BFGS update failed.

    103
          The maximum number of iterations was reached.

 -- Command:  pkg COMMAND PKG_NAME
 -- Command:  pkg COMMAND OPTION PKG_NAME
     Manage packages (groups of add-on functions) for Octave.  Different actions are available depending on the value of COMMAND.

     Available commands:

    `install'
          Install named packages.  For example,

               pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz

          installs the package found in the file `image-1.0.0.tar.gz'.

          The OPTION variable can contain options that affect the manner in which a package is installed.  These options can be one or more of

         `-nodeps'
               The package manager will disable dependency checking.  With this option it is possible to install a package even when it depends on another package which is not installed on the system.  *Use this option with care.*

         `-noauto'
               The package manager will not automatically load the installed package when starting Octave.  This overrides any setting within the package.

         `-auto'
               The package manager will automatically load the installed package when starting Octave.  This overrides any setting within the package.

         `-local'
               A local installation (package available only to current user) is forced, even if the user has system privileges.

         `-global'
               A global installation (package available to all users) is forced, even if the user doesn't normally have system privileges.

         `-forge'
               Install a package directly from the Octave-Forge repository.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.

         `-verbose'
               The package manager will print the output of all commands as they are performed.

    `update'
          Check installed Octave-Forge packages against repository and update any outdated items.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.  Usage:

               pkg update

    `uninstall'
          Uninstall named packages.  For example,

               pkg uninstall image

          removes the `image' package from the system.  If another installed package depends on the `image' package an error will be issued.  The package can be uninstalled anyway by using the `-nodeps' option.

    `load'
          Add named packages to the path.  After loading a package it is possible to use the functions provided by the package.  For example,

               pkg load image

          adds the `image' package to the path.  It is possible to load all installed packages at once with the keyword `all'.  Usage:

               pkg load all

    `unload'
          Remove named packages from the path.  After unloading a package it is no longer possible to use the functions provided by the package.  It is possible to unload all installed packages at once with the keyword `all'.  Usage:

               pkg unload all

    `list'
          Show the list of currently installed packages.  For example,

               installed_packages = pkg ("list")

          returns a cell array containing a structure for each installed package.

          If two output arguments are requested `pkg' splits the list of installed packages into those which were installed by the current user, and those which were installed by the system administrator.

               [user_packages, system_packages] = pkg ("list")

          The option "-forge" lists packages available at the Octave-Forge repository.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.  For example:

               oct_forge_pkgs = pkg ("list", "-forge")

    `describe'
          Show a short description of the named installed packages, with the option "-verbose" also list functions provided by the package.  For example,

               pkg describe -verbose all

          will describe all installed packages and the functions they provide.  If one output is requested a cell of structure containing the description and list of functions of each package is returned as output rather than printed on screen:

               desc = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")

          If any of the requested packages is not installed, pkg returns an error, unless a second output is requested:

               [desc, flag] = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")

          FLAG will take one of the values "Not installed", "Loaded" or "Not loaded" for each of the named packages.

    `prefix'
          Set the installation prefix directory.  For example,

               pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages

          sets the installation prefix to `~/my_octave_packages'.  Packages will be installed in this directory.

          It is possible to get the current installation prefix by requesting an output argument.  For example:

               pfx = pkg ("prefix")

          The location in which to install the architecture dependent files can be independently specified with an addition argument.  For example:

               pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages ~/my_arch_dep_pkgs

    `local_list'
          Set the file in which to look for information on locally installed packages.  Locally installed packages are those that are available only to the current user.  For example:

               pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages

          It is possible to get the current value of local_list with the following

               pkg local_list

    `global_list'
          Set the file in which to look for information on globally installed packages.  Globally installed packages are those that are available to all users.  For example:

               pkg global_list /usr/share/octave/octave_packages

          It is possible to get the current value of global_list with the following

               pkg global_list

    `build'
          Build a binary form of a package or packages.  The binary file produced will itself be an Octave package that can be installed normally with `pkg'.  The form of the command to build a binary package is

               pkg build builddir image-1.0.0.tar.gz ...

          where `builddir' is the name of a directory where the temporary installation will be produced and the binary packages will be found.  The options `-verbose' and `-nodeps' are respected, while all other options are ignored.

    `rebuild'
          Rebuild the package database from the installed directories.  This can be used in cases where the package database has been corrupted.  It can also take the `-auto' and `-noauto' options to allow the autoloading state of a package to be changed.  For example,

               pkg rebuild -noauto image

          will remove the autoloading status of the image package.

 -- Function File: LIMITS = axis ()
     Set axis limits for plots.

     The argument LIMITS should be a 2-, 4-, or 6-element vector.  The first and second elements specify the lower and upper limits for the x-axis.  The third and fourth specify the limits for the y-axis, and the fifth and sixth specify the limits for the z-axis.

     Without any arguments, `axis' turns autoscaling on.

     With one output argument, `x = axis' returns the current axes.

     The vector argument specifying limits is optional, and additional string arguments may be used to specify various axis properties.  For example,

          axis ([1, 2, 3, 4], "square");

     forces a square aspect ratio, and

          axis ("tic", "labely");

     turns tic marks on for all axes and tic mark labels on for the y-axis only.

     The following options control the aspect ratio of the axes.

    "square"
          Force a square aspect ratio.

    "equal"
          Force x distance to equal y-distance.

    "normal"
          Restore the balance.

     The following options control the way axis limits are interpreted.

    "auto"
          Set the specified axes to have nice limits around the data or all if no axes are specified.

    "manual"
          Fix the current axes limits.

    "tight"
          Fix axes to the limits of the data.

     The option `"image"' is equivalent to `"tight"' and `"equal"'.

     The following options affect the appearance of tic marks.

    "on"
          Turn tic marks and labels on for all axes.

    "off"
          Turn tic marks off for all axes.

    "tic[xyz]"
          Turn tic marks on for all axes, or turn them on for the specified axes and off for the remainder.

    "label[xyz]"
          Turn tic labels on for all axes, or turn them on for the specified axes and off for the remainder.

    "nolabel"
          Turn tic labels off for all axes.
     Note, if there are no tic marks for an axis, there can be no labels.

     The following options affect the direction of increasing values on the axes.

    "ij"
          Reverse y-axis, so lower values are nearer the top.

    "xy"
          Restore y-axis, so higher values are nearer the top.

     If an axes handle is passed as the first argument, then operate on this axes rather than the current axes.

 -- Function File:  bar (H, ...)
     Produce a bar graph from two vectors of x-y data.

     If only one argument is given, Y, it is taken as a vector of y-values and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements.

     The default width of 0.8 for the bars can be changed using W.

     If Y is a matrix, then each column of Y is taken to be a separate bar graph plotted on the same graph.  By default the columns are plotted side-by-side.  This behavior can be changed by the STYLE argument, which can take the values `"grouped"' (the default), or `"stacked"'.

     The optional return value H is a handle to the created "bar series" object with one handle per column of the variable Y.  This series allows common elements of the group of bar series objects to be changed in a single bar series and the same properties are changed in the other "bar series".  For example,

          h = bar (rand (5, 10));
          set (h(1), "basevalue", 0.5);

     changes the position on the base of all of the bar series.

     The optional input handle H allows an axis handle to be passed.

     The bar graph's appearance may be modified by specifying property/value pairs.  The following example modifies the face and edge colors.

          bar (randn (1, 100), "facecolor", "r", "edgecolor", "b")

     The color of the bars is taken from the figure's colormap, such that

          bar (rand (10, 3));
          colormap (summer (64));

     will change the colors used for the bars.  The color of bars can also be set manually using the "facecolor" property as shown below.

          h = bar (rand (10, 3));
          set (h(1), "facecolor", "r")
          set (h(2), "facecolor", "g")

     Add labels to the contours of a contour plot.  The contour plot is specified by the contour matrix C and optionally the contourgroup object H that are returned by `contour', `contourf' and `contour3'.  The contour labels are rotated and placed in the contour itself.

     By default, all contours are labeled.  However, the contours to label can be specified by the vector V.  If the "manual" argument is given then the contours to label can be selected with the mouse.

     Additional property/value pairs that are valid properties of text objects can be given and are passed to the underlying text objects.  Additionally, the property "LabelSpacing" is available allowing the spacing between labels on a contour (in points) to be specified.  The default is 144 points, or 2 inches.

     The optional return value H is a vector of graphics handles to the text objects representing each label.  The "userdata" property of the text objects contains the numerical value of the contour label.

     An example of the use of `clabel' is

     Plot level curves (contour lines) of the matrix Z, using the contour matrix C computed by `contourc' from the same arguments; see the latter for their interpretation.  The contours are plotted at the Z level corresponding to their contour.  The set of contour levels, C, is only returned if requested.  For example:

          contour3 (peaks (19));
          hold on
          surface (peaks (19), "facecolor", "none", "EdgeColor", "black");
          colormap hot;

     The style to use for the plot can be defined with a line style STYLE in a similar manner to the line styles used with the `plot' command.  Any markers defined by STYLE are ignored.

     The optional input and output argument H allows an axis handle to be passed to `contour' and the handles to the contour objects to be returned.

 -- Function File: [C, LEV] = contourc (X, Y, Z, VN)
     Compute isolines (contour lines) of the matrix Z.  Parameters X, Y and VN are optional.

     The return value LEV is a vector of the contour levels.  The return value C is a 2 by N matrix containing the contour lines in the following format

          C = [lev1, x1, x2, ..., levn, x1, x2, ...
               len1, y1, y2, ..., lenn, y1, y2, ...]

     in which contour line N has a level (height) of LEVN and length of LENN.

     If X and Y are omitted they are taken as the row/column index of Z.  VN is either a scalar denoting the number of lines to compute or a vector containing the values of the lines.  If only one value is wanted, set `VN = [val, val]'; If VN is omitted it defaults to 10.

     For example:

          x = 0:2;
          y = x;
          z = x' * y;
          contourc (x, y, z, 2:3)

     Compute and plot filled contours of the matrix Z.  Parameters X, Y and N or LVL are optional.

     The return value C is a 2xn matrix containing the contour lines as described in the help to the contourc function.

     The return value H is handle-vector to the patch objects creating the filled contours.

     If X and Y are omitted they are taken as the row/column index of Z.  N is a scalar denoting the number of lines to compute.  Alternatively LVL is a vector containing the contour levels.  If only one value (e.g., lvl0) is wanted, set LVL to [lvl0, lvl0].  If both N or LVL are omitted a default value of 10 contour level is assumed.

     If provided, the filled contours are added to the axes object AX instead of the current axis.

     The following example plots filled contours of the `peaks' function.

          [x, y, z] = peaks (50);
          contourf (x, y, z, -7:9)

errorbar


# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string
# elements: 1
# length: 2187
 -- Function File:  errorbar (ARGS)
     This function produces two-dimensional plots with errorbars.  Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          errorbar (Y, EY)

     where the first argument is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the second argument EY is taken as the errors of the Y values.  X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

     If more than two arguments are given, they are interpreted as

          errorbar (X, Y, ..., FMT, ...)

     where after X and Y there can be up to four error parameters such as EY, EX, LY, UY, etc., depending on the plot type.  Any number of argument sets may appear, as long as they are separated with a format string FMT.

     If Y is a matrix, X and error parameters must also be matrices having same dimensions.  The columns of Y are plotted versus the corresponding columns of X and errorbars are drawn from the corresponding columns of error parameters.

     If FMT is missing, yerrorbars ("~") plot style is assumed.

     If the FMT argument is supplied, it is interpreted as in normal plots.  In addition, FMT may include an errorbar style which must precede the line and marker format.  The following plot styles are supported by errorbar:

    `~'
          Set yerrorbars plot style (default).

    `>'
          Set xerrorbars plot style.

    `~>'
          Set xyerrorbars plot style.

    `#'
          Set boxes plot style.

    `#~'
          Set boxerrorbars plot style.

    `#~>'
          Set boxxyerrorbars plot style.

     Examples:

          errorbar (X, Y, EX, ">")

     produces an xerrorbar plot of Y versus X with X errorbars drawn from X-EX to X+EX.

          errorbar (X, Y1, EY, "~",
                    X, Y2, LY, UY)

     produces yerrorbar plots with Y1 and Y2 versus X.  Errorbars for Y1 are drawn from Y1-EY to Y1+EY, errorbars for Y2 from Y2-LY to Y2+UY.

          errorbar (X, Y, LX, UX,
                    LY, UY, "~>")

     produces an xyerrorbar plot of Y versus X in which X errorbars are drawn from X-LX to X+UX and Y errorbars from Y-LY to Y+UY.

     If DOM is a two element vector, it represents the minimum and maximum value of both X and Y.  If DOM is a four element vector, then the minimum and maximum value of X and Y are specify separately.

     N is a scalar defining the number of points to use in each dimension.

     If three functions are passed, then plot the parametrically defined function `[FX (S, T), FY (S, T), FZ (S, T)]'.

     If the argument "circ" is given, then the function is plotted over a disk centered on the middle of the domain DOM.

     The optional return value H is a 2-element vector with a graphics for the created surface plot and a second handle for the created contour plot.

          f = @(x,y) sqrt (abs (x .* y)) ./ (1 + x.^2 + y.^2);
          ezsurfc (f, [-3, 3]);

 -- Function File: H = findobj ("flat", ...)
 -- Function File: H = findobj (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = findobj (H, "-depth", D, ...)
     Find graphics object with specified property values.  The simplest form is

          findobj (PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     which returns all of the handles to the objects with the name PROP_NAME and the name PROP_VALUE.  The search can be limited to a particular object or set of objects and their descendants by passing a handle or set of handles H as the first argument to `findobj'.

     The depth of hierarchy of objects to which to search to can be limited with the "-depth" argument.  To limit the number depth of the hierarchy to search to D generations of children, and example is

          findobj (H, "-depth", D, PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     Specifying a depth D of 0, limits the search to the set of object passed in H.  A depth D of 0 is equivalent to the "-flat" argument.

     A specified logical operator may be applied to the pairs of PROP_NAME and PROP_VALUE.  The supported logical operators are "-and", "-or", "-xor", "-not".

     The objects may also be matched by comparing a regular expression to the property values, where property values that match `regexp (PROP_VALUE, PATTERN)' are returned.  Finally, objects may be matched by property name only, using the "-property" option.

 -- Function File: [...] = hist (..., PROP, VAL)
     Produce histogram counts or plots.

     With one vector input argument, Y, plot a histogram of the values with 10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range of the data.  With one matrix input argument, Y, plot a histogram where each bin contains a bar per input column.

     Given a second vector argument, X, use that as the centers of the bins, with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent values in the vector.

     If scalar, the second argument, NBINS, defines the number of bins.

     If a third argument is provided, the histogram is normalized such that the sum of the bars is equal to NORM.

     Extreme values are lumped in the first and last bins.

     With two output arguments, produce the values NN and XX such that `bar (XX, NN)' will plot the histogram.

     The histogram's appearance may be modified by specifying property/value pairs, PROP and VAL pairs.  For example the face and edge color may be modified.

          hist (randn (1, 100), 25, "facecolor", "r", "edgecolor", "b");

     The histograms colors also depend upon the colormap.

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument C is a three-dimensional array that contains color values and the second input argument V keeps the vertices of a geometry then return a matrix CD with color data information for the geometry at computed points `[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument CD can be taken to manually set FaceVertexCData of a patch.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays of the same size than C then the color data is taken at those given points.  Instead of the color data C this function can also be called with RGB values R, G, B.  If input argumnets X, Y, Z are not given then again `meshgrid' computed values are taken.

     Optionally, the patch handle P can be given as the last input argument to all variations of function calls instead of the vertices data V.  Finally, if no output argument is given then directly change the colors of a patch that is given by the patch handle P.

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument VAL is a three-dimensional array that contains the data for an isosurface geometry and the second input argument V keeps the vertices of an isosurface then return the normals N in form of a matrix with the same size than V at computed points `[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument N can be taken to manually set VERTEXNORMALS of a patch.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays with the same size than VAL then the volume data is taken at those given points.  Instead of the vertices data V a patch handle P can be passed to this function.

     If given the string input argument "negate" as last input argument then compute the reverse vector normals of an isosurface geometry.

     If no output argument is given then directly redraw the patch that is given by the patch handle P.

     For example:

          function [] = isofinish (p)
            set (gca, "PlotBoxAspectRatioMode", "manual", ...
                      "PlotBoxAspectRatio", [1 1 1]);

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument VAL is a three-dimensional array that contains the data of an isosurface geometry and the second input argument ISO keeps the isovalue as a scalar value then return a structure array FV that contains the fields FACES and VERTICES at computed points `[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument FV can directly be taken as an input argument for the `patch' function.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays with the same size than VAL then the volume data is taken at those given points.

     The string input argument "noshare" is only for compatibility and has no effect.  If given the string input argument "verbose" then print messages to the command line interface about the current progress.

     If called with the input argument COL which is a three-dimensional array of the same size than VAL then take those values for the interpolation of coloring the isosurface geometry.  Add the field FACEVERTEXCDATA to the structure array FV.

     If called with two or three output arguments then return the information about the faces F, vertices V and color data C as seperate arrays instead of a single structure array.

     If called with no output argument then directly process the isosurface geometry with the `patch' command.

     For example,

          [x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:5, 1:5, 1:5);
          val = rand (5, 5, 5);
          isosurface (x, y, z, val, .5);

     will directly draw a random isosurface geometry in a graphics window.  Another example for an isosurface geometry with different additional coloring

     Plot a mesh given matrices X, and Y from `meshgrid' and a matrix Z corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of the mesh.  If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), Z(i,j)).  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.

     The color of the mesh is derived from the `colormap' and the value of Z.  Optionally the color of the mesh can be specified independent of Z, by adding a fourth matrix, C.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created surface object.

     Draw a Pareto chart, also called ABC chart.  A Pareto chart is a bar graph used to arrange information in such a way that priorities for process improvement can be established.  It organizes and displays information to show the relative importance of data.  The chart is similar to the histogram or bar chart, except that the bars are arranged in decreasing order from left to right along the abscissa.

     The fundamental idea (Pareto principle) behind the use of Pareto diagrams is that the majority of an effect is due to a small subset of the causes, so for quality improvement the first few (as presented on the diagram) contributing causes to a problem usually account for the majority of the result.  Thus, targeting these "major causes" for elimination results in the most cost-effective improvement scheme.

     The data are passed as X and the abscissa as Y.  If Y is absent, then the abscissa are assumed to be `1 : length (X)'.  Y can be a string array, a cell array of strings or a numerical vector.

     The optional return value H is a 2-element vector with a graphics handle for the created bar plot and a second handle for the created line plot.

     An example of the use of `pareto' is

          Cheese = {"Cheddar", "Swiss", "Camembert", ...
                    "Munster", "Stilton", "Blue"};
          Sold = [105, 30, 70, 10, 15, 20];

     Density plot for given matrices X, and Y from `meshgrid' and a matrix C corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of the mesh's vertices.  If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), C(i,j)).  Thus, columns of C correspond to different X values and rows of C correspond to different Y values.

     The `colormap' is scaled to the extents of C.  Limits may be placed on the color axis by the command `caxis', or by setting the `clim' property of the parent axis.

     The face color of each cell of the mesh is determined by interpolating the values of C for the cell's vertices.  Contrast this with `imagesc' which renders one cell for each element of C.

     `shading' modifies an attribute determining the manner by which the face color of each cell is interpolated from the values of C, and the visibility of the cells' edges.  By default the attribute is "faceted", which renders a single color for each cell's face with the edge visible.

     H is the handle to the surface object.

     Produce two-dimensional plots.

     Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot (Y)

     where the argument is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements starting with 1.

     To save a plot, in one of several image formats such as PostScript or PNG, use the `print' command.

     If more than one argument is given, they are interpreted as

          plot (Y, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     or

          plot (X, Y, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     or

          plot (X, Y, FMT, ...)

     and so on.  Any number of argument sets may appear.  The X and Y values are interpreted as follows:

        * If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

        * If the X is a vector and Y is a matrix, then the columns (or rows) of Y are plotted versus X.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

        * If the X is a matrix and Y is a vector, Y is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of X.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

        * If both arguments are vectors, the elements of Y are plotted versus the elements of X.

        * If both arguments are matrices, the columns of Y are plotted versus the columns of X.  In this case, both matrices must have the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

          If both arguments are scalars, a single point is plotted.

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified, but they must appear in pairs.  These arguments are applied to the lines drawn by `plot'.

     If the FMT argument is supplied, it is interpreted as follows.  If FMT is missing, the default gnuplot line style is assumed.

    `-'
          Set lines plot style (default).

    `.'
          Set dots plot style.

    `N'
          Interpreted as the plot color if N is an integer in the range 1 to 6.

    `NM'
          If NM is a two digit integer and M is an integer in the range 1 to 6, M is interpreted as the point style.  This is only valid in combination with the `@' or `-@' specifiers.

    `C'
          If C is one of `"k"' (black), `"r"' (red), `"g"' (green), `"b"' (blue), `"m"' (magenta), `"c"' (cyan), or `"w"' (white), it is interpreted as the line plot color.

    `";title;"'
          Here `"title"' is the label for the key.

    `+'
    `*'
    `o'
    `x'
    `^'
          Used in combination with the points or linespoints styles, set the point style.

    `@'
          Select the next unused point style.

     The FMT argument may also be used to assign key titles.  To do so, include the desired title between semi-colons after the formatting sequence described above, e.g., "+3;Key Title;" Note that the last semi-colon is required and will generate an error if it is left out.

     Here are some plot examples:

          plot (x, y, "@12", x, y2, x, y3, "4", x, y4, "+")

     This command will plot `y' with points of type 2 (displayed as `+') and color 1 (red), `y2' with lines, `y3' with lines of color 4 (magenta) and `y4' with points displayed as `+'.

          plot (b, "*", "markersize", 3)

     This command will plot the data in the variable `b', with points displayed as `*' with a marker size of 3.

          t = 0:0.1:6.3;
          plot (t, cos(t), "-;cos(t);", t, sin(t), "+3;sin(t);");

     This will plot the cosine and sine functions and label them accordingly in the key.

     If the first argument is an axis handle, then plot into these axes, rather than the current axis handle returned by `gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created plot.

     Produce three-dimensional plots.  Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot3 (X, Y, Z)

     in which the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points to be plotted in three dimensions.  If all arguments are vectors of the same length, then a single continuous line is drawn.  If all arguments are matrices, then each column of the matrices is treated as a separate line.  No attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

     If only two arguments are given, as

          plot3 (X, C)

     the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as the Y and Z coordinates, respectively.

     If only one argument is given, as

          plot3 (C)

     the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the Y and Z values, and they are plotted versus their index.

     Arguments may also be given in groups of three as

          plot3 (X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...)

     in which each set of three arguments is treated as a separate line or set of lines in three dimensions.

     To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group with an empty format string, as

          plot3 (X1, C1, "", C2, "", ...)

     An example of the use of `plot3' is

     Scatter plot of the columns of one matrix against another.  Given the arguments X and Y, that have a matching number of rows, `plotmatrix' plots a set of axes corresponding to

     The marker to use can be changed with the STYLE argument, that is a string defining a marker in the same manner as the `plot' command.  If a leading axes handle H is passed to `plotmatrix', then this axis will be used for the plot.

     The optional return value H provides handles to the individual graphics objects in the scatter plots, whereas AX returns the handles to the scatter plot axis objects.  BIGAX is a hidden axis object that surrounds the other axes, such that the commands `xlabel', `title', etc., will be associated with this hidden axis.

     FILENAME defines the name of the output file.  If the file name has no suffix, one is inferred from the specified device and appended to the file name.  If no filename is specified, the output is sent to the printer.

     For output to a printer, to a PostScript file, or a PDF file, the paper size is specified by the figure's `papersize' property.  The location and size of the image on the page are specified by the figure's `paperposition' property.  The orientation of the page is specified by the figure's `paperorientation' property.

     The width and height of images are specified by the figure's `paperpositon(3:4)' property values.

     The `print' command supports several OPTIONS:

    `-fH'
          Specify the handle, H, of the figure to be printed.  The   default is the current figure.

    `-PPRINTER'
          Set the PRINTER name to which the graph is sent if no FILENAME is specified.

    `-GGHOSTSCRIPT_COMMAND'
          Specify the command for calling Ghostscript.  For Unix and Windows, the defaults are 'gs' and 'gswin32c', respectively.

    `-color'
    `-mono'
          Monochrome or color output.

    `-solid'
    `-dashed'
          Forces all lines to be solid or dashed, respectively.

    `-portrait'
    `-landscape'
          Specify the orientation of the plot for printed output.  For non-printed output the aspect ratio of the output corresponds to the plot area defined by the "paperposition" property in the orientation specified.  This options is equivalent to changing the figure's "paperorientation" property.

    `-TextAlphaBits=N'
    `-GraphicsAlphaBits=N'
          Octave is able to produce output for various printers, bitmaps, and vector formats by using ghostscript.  For bitmap and printer output antialiasing is applied using ghostscript's TextAlphaBits and GraphicsAlphaBits options.  The default number of bits for each is 4.  Allowed values, for N, are 1, 2, or 4.

    `-dDEVICE'
          The available output format is specified by the option DEVICE,   and is one of:

         `ps'
         `ps2'
         `psc'
         `psc2'
               Postscript (level 1 and 2, mono and color).  The FLTK graphics     toolkit generates Postscript level 3.0.

         `eps'
         `eps2'
         `epsc'
         `epsc2'
               Encapsulated postscript (level 1 and 2, mono and color).  The FLTK graphic toolkit generates Postscript level 3.0.

         `tex'
         `epslatex'
         `epslatexstandalone'
         `pstex'
         `pslatex'
         `pdflatex'
               Generate a LaTeX (or TeX) file for labels, and eps/ps/pdf for graphics.  The file produced by `epslatexstandalone' can be processed directly by LaTeX.  The other formats are intended to be included in a LaTeX (or TeX) document.  The `tex' device is the same as the `epslatex' device.  The `pdflatex' device is only available for the FLTK graphics toolkit.

         `tikz'
               Generate a LaTeX file using PGF/TikZ.  For the FLTK the result is   PGF.

          If the device is omitted, it is inferred from the file extension, or if there is no filename it is sent to the printer as postscript.

    `-dGHOSTSCRIPT_DEVICE'
          Additional devices are supported by Ghostscript.  Some examples are;

         `ljet2p'
               HP LaserJet IIP

         `ljet3'
               HP LaserJet III

         `cdj550'
               HP DeskJet 550C

         `paintjet'
               HP PointJet

         `pcx24b'
               24-bit color PCX file format

         `ppm'
               Portable Pixel Map file format

         `pdfwrite'
               Produces pdf output from eps

          For a complete list, type `system ("gs -h")' to see what formats and devices are available.

          When Ghostscript output is sent to a printer the size is determined by the figure's "papersize" property.  When the output is sent to a file the size is determined by the plot box defined by the figure's "paperposition" property.

    `-append'
          Appends the PS, or PDF output to a pre-existing file of the same type.

    `-rNUM'
          Resolution of bitmaps in pixels per inch.  For both metafiles and SVG the default is the screen resolution, for other it is 150 dpi.  To specify screen resolution, use "-r0".

    `-tight'
          Forces a tight bounding box for eps-files.

    `-PREVIEW'
          Adds a preview to eps-files.  Supported formats are;

         `-interchange'
               Provides an interchange preview.

         `-metalfile'
               Provides a metafile preview.

         `-pict'
               Provides pict preview.

         `-tiff'
               Provides a tiff preview.

    `-SXSIZE,YSIZE'
          Plot size in pixels for EMF, GIF, JPEG, PBM, PNG and SVG.  For PS, EPS, PDF, and other vector formats the plot size is in points.  This option is equivalent to changing the size of the plot box associated with "paperposition" property.  Using the command form of the print function, you must quote the XSIZE,YSIZE option.  For example, by writing `"-S640,480"'.

    `-FFONTNAME'
    `-FFONTNAME:SIZE'
    `-F:SIZE'
          Associates all text with the FONTNAME and/or FONTSIZE.  FONTNAME is ignored for some devices; dxf, fig, hpgl, etc.

     The filename and options can be given in any order.

     Example: Print to a file, using the svg device.

          figure (1);
          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print -dsvg figure1.svg

     Example: Print to an HP Deskjet 550C.

          figure (1);
          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print -dcdj550

     Plot the `(U, V)' components of a vector field in an `(X, Y)' meshgrid.  If the grid is uniform, you can specify X and Y as vectors.

     If X and Y are undefined they are assumed to be `(1:M, 1:N)' where `[M, N] = size(U)'.

     The variable S is a scalar defining a scaling factor to use for the arrows of the field relative to the mesh spacing.  A value of 0 disables all scaling.  The default value is 1.

     The style to use for the plot can be defined with a line style STYLE in a similar manner to the line styles used with the `plot' command.  If a marker is specified then markers at the grid points of the vectors are printed rather than arrows.  If the argument "filled" is given then the markers as filled.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to a quiver object.  A quiver object regroups the components of the quiver plot (body, arrow, and marker), and allows them to be changed together.

     Draw rectangular patch defined by POS and CURV.  The variable `POS(1:2)' defines the lower left-hand corner of the patch and `POS(3:4)' defines its width and height.  By default, the value of POS is `[0, 0, 1, 1]'.

     The variable CURV defines the curvature of the sides of the rectangle and may be a scalar or two-element vector with values between 0 and 1.  A value of 0 represents no curvature of the side, whereas a value of 1 means that the side is entirely curved into the arc of a circle.  If CURV is a two-element vector, then the first element is the curvature along the x-axis of the patch and the second along y-axis.

     If CURV is a scalar, it represents the curvature of the shorter of the two sides of the rectangle and the curvature of the other side is defined by

          min (pos (1:2)) / max (pos (1:2)) * curv

     Reduce the faces area for a given patch, structure or explicit faces and points matrices by a scale factor SF.  The structure FV must contain the fields 'faces' and 'vertices'.  If the factor SF is omitted then a default of 0.3 is used.

     Given a patch handle as the first input argument and no output parameters, perform the shrinking of the patch faces in place and redraw the patch.

     If called with one output argument, return a structure with fields 'faces', 'vertices', and 'facevertexcdata' containing the data after shrinking which can then directly be used as an input argument for the `patch' function.

     Performing the shrinking on faces which are not convex can lead to undesired results.

     For example,

          [phi r] = meshgrid (linspace (0, 1.5*pi, 16), linspace (1, 2, 4));
          tri = delaunay (phi(:), r(:));

 -- Function File: H = slice (..., METHOD)
     Plot slices of 3-D data/scalar fields.  Each element of the 3-dimensional array V represents a scalar value at a location given by the parameters X, Y, and Z.  The parameters X, X, and Z are either 3-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in the "meshgrid" format or vectors.  The parameters XI, etc. respect a similar format to X, etc., and they represent the points at which the array VI is interpolated using interp3.  The vectors SX, SY, and SZ contain points of orthogonal slices of the respective axes.

     If X, Y, Z are omitted, they are assumed to be `x = 1:size (V, 2)', `y = 1:size (V, 1)' and `z = 1:size (V, 3)'.

     METHOD is one of:

    "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    "linear"
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors (not implemented yet).

    "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve.

     The default method is `"linear"'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created surface object.

     Examples:

 -- Function File: H = stem (...)
     Plot a stem graph from two vectors of x-y data.  If only one argument is given, it is taken as the y-values and the x coordinates are taken from the indices of the elements.

     If Y is a matrix, then each column of the matrix is plotted as a separate stem graph.  In this case X can either be a vector, the same length as the number of rows in Y, or it can be a matrix of the same size as Y.

     The default color is `"b"' (blue).  The default line style is `"-"' and the default marker is `"o"'.  The line style can be altered by the `linespec' argument in the same manner as the `plot' command.  For example,

          x = 1:10;
          y = 2*x;
          stem (x, y, "r");

     plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20 in red;

     The optional return value H is a vector of "stem series" graphics handles with one handle per column of the variable Y.  The handle regroups the elements of the stem graph together as the children of the "stem series" handle, allowing them to be altered together.  For example,

          x = [0:10]';
          y = [sin(x), cos(x)]
          h = stem (x, y);
          set (h(2), "color", "g");
          set (h(1), "basevalue", -1)

     changes the color of the second "stem series" and moves the base line of the first.

     Set up a plot grid with ROWS by COLS subwindows and plot in location given by INDEX.

     If only one argument is supplied, then it must be a three digit value specifying the location in digits 1 (rows) and 2 (columns) and the plot index in digit 3.

     The plot index runs row-wise.  First all the columns in a row are filled and then the next row is filled.

     For example, a plot with 2 by 3 grid will have plot indices running as follows:

          +-----+-----+-----+
          |  1  |  2  |  3  |
          +-----+-----+-----+
          |  4  |  5  |  6  |
          +-----+-----+-----+

     INDEX may be a vector.  In which case, the new axis will enclose the grid locations specified.  The first demo illustrates an example:

     The material properties of the surface can specified using a 4-element vector P = [AM D SP EXP] which defaults to P = [0.55 0.6 0.4 10].

    "AM" strength of ambient light

     Find the vectors normal to a meshgridded surface.  The meshed gridded surface is defined by X, Y, and Z.  If X and Y are not defined, then it is assumed that they are given by

          [X, Y] = meshgrid (1:size (Z, 1),
                             1:size (Z, 2));

     If no return arguments are requested, a surface plot with the normal vectors to the surface is plotted.  Otherwise the components of the normal vectors at the mesh gridded points are returned in NX, NY, and NZ.

     The normal vectors are calculated by taking the cross product of the diagonals of each of the quadrilaterals in the meshgrid to find the normal vectors of the centers of these quadrilaterals.  The four nearest normal vectors to the meshgrid points are then averaged to obtain the normal to the surface at the meshgridded points.

     Display the tetrahedrons defined in the m-by-4 matrix T as 3-D patches.  T is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation of a 3-D set of points.  Every row of T contains four indices into the n-by-3 matrix X of the vertices of a tetrahedron.  Every row in X represents one point in 3-D space.

     The vector C specifies the color of each tetrahedron as an index into the current colormap.  The default value is 1:m where m is the number of tetrahedrons; the indices are scaled to map to the full range of the colormap.  If there are more tetrahedrons than colors in the colormap then the values in C are cyclically repeated.

     Calling `tetramesh (..., "property", "value", ...)' passes all property/value pairs directly to the patch function as additional arguments.

     The optional return value H is a vector of patch handles where each handle represents one tetrahedron in the order given by T.  A typical use case for H is to turn the respective patch "visible" property "on" or "off".

     Open a GUI dialog for selecting a file.  It returns the filename FNAME, the path to this file FPATH, and the filter index FLTIDX.  FLT contains a (list of) file filter string(s) in one of the following formats:

    "/path/to/filename.ext"
          If a filename is given then the file extension is extracted and used as filter.  In addition, the path is selected as current path and the filename is selected as default file.  Example: `uigetfile ("myfun.m")'

    A single file extension "*.ext"
          Example: `uigetfile ("*.ext")'

    A 2-column cell array
          containing a file extension in the first column and a brief description in the second column.  Example: `uigetfile ({"*.ext", "My Description";"*.xyz", "XYZ-Format"})'

          The filter string can also contain a semicolon separated list of filter extensions.  Example: `uigetfile ({"*.gif;*.png;*.jpg", "Supported Picture Formats"})'

     DIALOG_NAME can be used to customize the dialog title.  If DEFAULT_FILE is given then it will be selected in the GUI dialog.  If, in addition, a path is given it is also used as current path.

     The screen position of the GUI dialog can be set using the "Position" key and a 2-element vector containing the pixel coordinates.  Two or more files can be selected when setting the "MultiSelect" key to "on".  In that case FNAME is a cell array containing the files.

     Create a uimenu object and return a handle to it.  If H is ommited then a top-level menu for the current figure is created.  If H is given then a submenu relative to H is created.

     uimenu objects have the following specific properties:

    "accelerator"
          A string containing the key combination together with CTRL to execute this menu entry (e.g., "x" for CTRL+x).

    "callback"
          Is the function called when this menu entry is executed.  It can be either a function string (e.g., "myfun"), a function handle (e.g., @myfun) or a cell array containing the function handle and arguments for the callback function (e.g., {@myfun, arg1, arg2}).

    "checked"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  Sets a mark at this menu entry.

    "enable"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If disabled the menu entry cannot be selected and it is grayed out.

    "foregroundcolor"
          A color value setting the text color for this menu entry.

    "label"
          A string containing the label for this menu entry.  A "&"-symbol can be used to mark the "accelerator" character (e.g., "E&xit")

    "position"
          An scalar value containing the relative menu position.  The entry with the lowest value is at the first position starting from left or top.

    "separator"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If enabled it draws a separator line above the current position.  It is ignored for top level entries.


     Examples:

          f = uimenu ("label", "&File", "accelerator", "f");
          e = uimenu ("label", "&Edit", "accelerator", "e");
          uimenu (f, "label", "Close", "accelerator", "q", ...
                     "callback", "close (gcf)");

 -- Function File: PP = mkpp (BREAKS, COEFS)
 -- Function File: PP = mkpp (BREAKS, COEFS, D)
     Construct a piecewise polynomial (pp) structure from sample points BREAKS and coefficients COEFS.  BREAKS must be a vector of strictly increasing values.  The number of intervals is given by `NI = length (BREAKS) - 1'.  When M is the polynomial order COEFS must be of size: NI x M + 1.

     The i-th row of COEFS, `COEFS (I,:)', contains the coefficients for the polynomial over the I-th interval, ordered from highest (M) to lowest (0).

     COEFS may also be a multi-dimensional array, specifying a vector-valued or array-valued polynomial.  In that case the polynomial order is defined by the length of the last dimension of COEFS.  The size of first dimension(s) are given by the scalar or vector D.  If D is not given it is set to `1'.  In any case COEFS is reshaped to a 2-D matrix of size `[NI*prod(D M)] '

 -- Function File: [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P)
 -- Function File: [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P, TOL)
 -- Function File: [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P, TOL, REORDER)
     Identify unique poles in P and their associated multiplicity.  The output is ordered from largest pole to smallest pole.

     If the relative difference of two poles is less than TOL then they are considered to be multiples.  The default value for TOL is 0.001.

     If A is a square N-by-N matrix, `poly (A)' is the row vector of the coefficients of `det (z * eye (N) - A)', the characteristic polynomial of A.  For example, the following code finds the eigenvalues of A which are the roots of `poly (A)'.

          roots (poly (eye (3)))
              => 1.00001 + 0.00001i
                 1.00001 - 0.00001i
                 0.99999 + 0.00000i

     In fact, all three eigenvalues are exactly 1 which emphasizes that for numerical performance the `eig' function should be used to compute eigenvalues.

     If X is a vector, `poly (X)' is a vector of the coefficients of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of X.  That is, if C is a polynomial, then the elements of `D = roots (poly (C))' are contained in C.  The vectors C and D are not identical, however, due to sorting and numerical errors.

     Return the coefficients of a polynomial P(X) of degree N that minimizes the least-squares-error of the fit to the points `[X, Y]'.  If N is a logical vector, it is used as a mask to selectively force the corresponding polynomial coefficients to be used or ignored.

     The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

     The optional output S is a structure containing the following fields:

    `R'
          Triangular factor R from the QR decomposition.

    `X'
          The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial coefficients.

    `C'
          The unscaled covariance matrix, formally equal to the inverse of X'*X, but computed in a way minimizing roundoff error propagation.

    `df'

    `normr'
          The norm of the residuals.

    `yf'

     The second output may be used by `polyval' to calculate the statistical error limits of the predicted values.  In particular, the standard deviation of P coefficients is given by
     `sqrt (diag (s.C)/s.df)*s.normr'.

     When the third output, MU, is present the coefficients, P, are associated with a polynomial in XHAT = (X-MU(1))/MU(2).  Where MU(1) = mean (X), and MU(2) = std (X).  This linear transformation of X improves the numerical stability of the fit.

     The first calling form computes the partial fraction expansion for the quotient of the polynomials, B and A.

          B(s)    M       r(m)         N
          ---- = SUM -------------  + SUM k(i)*s^(N-i)
          A(s)   m=1 (s-p(m))^e(m)    i=1

     where M is the number of poles (the length of the R, P, and E), the K vector is a polynomial of order N-1 representing the direct contribution, and the E vector specifies the multiplicity of the m-th residue's pole.

     For example,

          b = [1, 1, 1];
          a = [1, -5, 8, -4];
          [r, p, k, e] = residue (b, a)
             => r = [-2; 7; 3]
             => p = [2; 2; 1]
             => k = [](0x0)
             => e = [1; 2; 1]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

                  s^2 + s + 1       -2        7        3
             ------------------- = ----- + ------- + -----
             s^3 - 5s^2 + 8s - 4   (s-2)   (s-2)^2   (s-1)

     The second calling form performs the inverse operation and computes the reconstituted quotient of polynomials, B(s)/A(s), from the partial fraction expansion; represented by the residues, poles, and a direct polynomial specified by R, P and K, and the pole multiplicity E.

     If the multiplicity, E, is not explicitly specified the multiplicity is determined by the function `mpoles'.

     For example:

          r = [-2; 7; 3];
          p = [2; 2; 1];
          k = [1, 0];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k)
             => b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
             => a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

          where mpoles is used to determine e = [1; 2; 1]

     Alternatively the multiplicity may be defined explicitly, for example,

          r = [7; 3; -2];
          p = [2; 1; 2];
          k = [1, 0];
          e = [2; 1; 1];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k, e)
             => b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
             => a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

           -2        7        3         s^4 - 5s^3 + 9s^2 - 3s + 1
          ----- + ------- + ----- + s = --------------------------

When called with a third input argument, `spline' evaluates the spline at the points XI.  The third calling form `spline (X, Y, XI)' is equivalent to `ppval (spline (X, Y), XI)'.

If the length of Y is N, then the "not-a-knot" end condition is used.  If the length of Y is `N + 2', then the first and last values of the vector Y are the values of the first derivative of the cubic spline at the endpoints.

     If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form `[S1, S2, ..., SK, N]' or `[S1, S2, ..., SK, N + 2]'.

     The fitted spline is returned as a piecewise polynomial, PP, and may be evaluated using `ppval'.

 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (X, Y, P)
     P is a positive integer defining the number of intervals along X, and P+1 is the number of breaks.  The number of points in each interval differ by no more than 1.

 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "periodic", PERIODIC)
 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "robust", ROBUST)
 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "beta", BETA)
 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "order", ORDER)
 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "constraints", CONSTRAINTS)
     The optional property PERIODIC is a logical value which specifies whether a periodic boundary condition is applied to the spline.  The length of the period is `max(BREAKS)-min(BREAKS)'.  The default value is `false'.

     The optional property ROBUST is a logical value which specifies if robust fitting is to be applied to reduce the influence of outlying data points.  Three iterations of weighted least squares are performed.  Weights are computed from previous residuals.  The sensitivity of outlier identification is controlled by the property BETA.  The value of BETA is stricted to the range, 0 < BETA < 1.  The default value is BETA = 1/2.  Values close to 0 give all data equal weighting.  Increasing values of BETA reduce the influence of outlying data.  Values close to unity may cause instability or rank deficiency.

     The splines are constructed of polynomials with degree ORDER.  The default is a cubic, ORDER=3.  A spline with P pieces has P+ORDER degrees of freedom.  With periodic boundary conditions the degrees of freedom are reduced to P.

     The optional property, CONSTAINTS, is a structure specifying linear constraints on the fit.  The structure has three fields, "xc", "yc", and "cc".

    "xc"
          Vector of the x-locations of the constraints.

    "yc"
          Constraining values at the locations, XC.  The default is an array of zeros.

    "cc"
          Coefficients (matrix).  The default is an array of ones.  The number of rows is limited to the order of the piecewise polynomials, ORDER.

     Constraints are linear combinations of derivatives of order 0 to ORDER-1 according to

          cc(1,j) * y(xc(j)) + cc(2,j) * y'(xc(j)) + ... = yc(:,...,:,j).

 -- Function File: [D, DD] = diffpara (X, A, B)
     Return the estimator D for the differencing parameter of an integrated time series.

     The frequencies from [2*pi*a/t, 2*pi*b/T] are used for the estimation.  If B is omitted, the interval [2*pi/T, 2*pi*a/T] is used.  If both B and A are omitted then a = 0.5 * sqrt (T) and b = 1.5 * sqrt (T) is used, where T is the sample size.  If X is a matrix, the differencing parameter of each column is estimated.

     The estimators for all frequencies in the intervals described above is returned in DD.  The value of D is simply the mean of DD.

     Convolve two vectors using the FFT for computation.

     `c = fftconv (X, Y)' returns a vector of length equal to `length (X) + length (Y) - 1'.  If X and Y are the coefficient vectors of two polynomials, the returned value is the coefficient vector of the product polynomial.

     The computation uses the FFT by calling the function `fftfilt'.  If the optional argument N is specified, an N-point FFT is used.

 -- Function File:  fftshift (X, DIM)
     Perform a shift of the vector X, for use with the `fft' and `ifft' functions, in order the move the frequency 0 to the center of the vector or matrix.

     If X is a vector of N elements corresponding to N time samples spaced by dt, then `fftshift (fft (X))' corresponds to frequencies

          f = [ -(ceil((N-1)/2):-1:1)*df 0 (1:floor((N-1)/2))*df ]

     where df = 1 / dt.

     If X is a matrix, the same holds for rows and columns.  If X is an array, then the same holds along each dimension.

     The optional DIM argument can be used to limit the dimension along which the permutation occurs.

 -- Function File: [X, FLAG, RELRES, ITER, RESVEC, EIGEST] = pcg (...)
     Solve the linear system of equations `A * X = B' by means of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient iterative method.  The input arguments are

        * A can be either a square (preferably sparse) matrix or a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of a function which computes `A * X'.  In principle A should be symmetric and positive definite; if `pcg' finds A to not be positive definite, you will get a warning message and the FLAG output parameter will be set.

        * B is the right hand side vector.

        * TOL is the required relative tolerance for the residual error, `B - A * X'.  The iteration stops if `norm (B - A * X) <= TOL * norm (B - A * X0)'.  If TOL is empty or is omitted, the function sets `TOL = 1e-6' by default.

        * MAXIT is the maximum allowable number of iterations; if `[]' is supplied for `maxit', or `pcg' has less arguments, a default value equal to 20 is used.

        * M = M1 * M2 is the (left) preconditioning matrix, so that the iteration is (theoretically) equivalent to solving by `pcg' `P * X = M \ B', with `P = M \ A'.  Note that a proper choice of the preconditioner may dramatically improve the overall performance of the method.  Instead of matrices M1 and M2, the user may pass two functions which return the results of applying the inverse of M1 and M2 to a vector (usually this is the preferred way of using the preconditioner).  If `[]' is supplied for M1, or M1 is omitted, no preconditioning is applied.  If M2 is omitted, M = M1 will be used as preconditioner.

        * X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is empty or omitted, the function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed in a proper way to any of the functions (A or M) which are passed to `pcg'.  See the examples below for further details.  The output arguments are

        * X is the computed approximation to the solution of `A * X = B'.

        * FLAG reports on the convergence.  `FLAG = 0' means the solution converged and the tolerance criterion given by TOL is satisfied.  `FLAG = 1' means that the MAXIT limit for the iteration count was reached.  `FLAG = 3' reports that the (preconditioned) matrix was found not positive definite.

        * RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        * ITER is the actual number of iterations performed.

        * RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method.  `RESVEC (i,1)' is the Euclidean norm of the residual, and `RESVEC (i,2)' is the preconditioned residual norm, after the (I-1)-th iteration, `I = 1, 2, ..., ITER+1'.  The preconditioned residual norm is defined as `norm (R) ^ 2 = R' * (M \ R)' where `R = B - A * X', see also the description of M.  If EIGEST is not required, only `RESVEC (:,1)' is returned.

        * EIGEST returns the estimate for the smallest `EIGEST (1)' and largest `EIGEST (2)' eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix `P = M \ A'.  In particular, if no preconditioning is used, the estimates for the extreme eigenvalues of A are returned.  `EIGEST (1)' is an overestimate and `EIGEST (2)' is an underestimate, so that `EIGEST (2) / EIGEST (1)' is a lower bound for `cond (P, 2)', which nevertheless in the limit should theoretically be equal to the actual value of the condition number.  The method which computes EIGEST works only for symmetric positive definite A and M, and the user is responsible for verifying this assumption.

     Let us consider a trivial problem with a diagonal matrix (we exploit the sparsity of A)

          n = 10;
          A = diag (sparse (1:n));
          b = rand (n, 1);
          [l, u, p, q] = luinc (A, 1.e-3);

     EXAMPLE 1: Simplest use of `pcg'

          x = pcg (A,b)

     EXAMPLE 2: `pcg' with a function which computes `A * X'

          function y = apply_a (x)
            y = [1:N]' .* x;
          endfunction

          x = pcg ("apply_a", b)

     EXAMPLE 3: `pcg' with a preconditioner: L * U

          x = pcg (A, b, 1.e-6, 500, l*u)

     EXAMPLE 4: `pcg' with a preconditioner: L * U.  Faster than EXAMPLE 3 since lower and upper triangular matrices are easier to invert

          x = pcg (A, b, 1.e-6, 500, l, u)

     EXAMPLE 5: Preconditioned iteration, with full diagnostics.  The preconditioner (quite strange, because even the original matrix A is trivial) is defined as a function

          function y = apply_m (x)
            k = floor (length (x) - 2);
            y = x;
            y(1:k) = x(1:k) ./ [1:k]';
          endfunction

          [x, flag, relres, iter, resvec, eigest] = ...
                             pcg (A, b, [], [], "apply_m");
          semilogy (1:iter+1, resvec);

     EXAMPLE 6: Finally, a preconditioner which depends on a parameter K.

          function y = apply_M (x, varargin)
            K = varargin{1};
            y = x;
            y(1:K) = x(1:K) ./ [1:K]';

 -- Function File: S = spaugment (A, C)
     Create the augmented matrix of A.  This is given by

          [C * eye(M, M), A;
                      A', zeros(N, N)]

     This is related to the least squares solution of `A \ B', by

          S * [ R / C; x] = [ B, zeros(N, columns(B)) ]

     where R is the residual error

          R = B - A * X

     As the matrix S is symmetric indefinite it can be factorized with `lu', and the minimum norm solution can therefore be found without the need for a `qr' factorization.  As the residual error will be `zeros (M, M)' for under determined problems, and example can be

          m = 11; n = 10; mn = max (m, n);
          A = spdiags ([ones(mn,1), 10*ones(mn,1), -ones(mn,1)],
                       [-1, 0, 1], m, n);
          x0 = A \ ones (m,1);
          s = spaugment (A);
          [L, U, P, Q] = lu (s);
          x1 = Q * (U \ (L \ (P  * [ones(m,1); zeros(n,1)])));
          x1 = x1(end - n + 1 : end);

     To find the solution of an overdetermined problem needs an estimate of the residual error R and so it is more complex to formulate a minimum norm solution using the `spaugment' function.

     In general the left division operator is more stable and faster than using the `spaugment' function.

     A generalization of the function `diag'.  Called with a single input argument, the non-zero diagonals C of A are extracted.  With two arguments the diagonals to extract are given by the vector C.

     The other two forms of `spdiags' modify the input matrix by replacing the diagonals.  They use the columns of V to replace the columns represented by the vector C.  If the sparse matrix A is defined then the diagonals of this matrix are replaced.  Otherwise a matrix of M by N is created with the diagonals given by V.

     Negative values of C represent diagonals below the main diagonal, and positive values of C diagonals above the main diagonal.

     For example:

          spdiags (reshape (1:12, 4, 3), [-1 0 1], 5, 4)
             => 5 10  0  0

 -- Function File: [U, S, V] = svds (...)
 -- Function File: [U, S, V, FLAG] = svds (...)
     Find a few singular values of the matrix A.  The singular values are calculated using

          [M, N] = size (A);
          S = eigs ([sparse(M, M), A;
                               A', sparse(N, N)])

     The eigenvalues returned by `eigs' correspond to the singular values of A.  The number of singular values to calculate is given by K and defaults to 6.

     The argument SIGMA specifies which singular values to find.  When SIGMA is the string 'L', the default, the largest singular values of A are found.  Otherwise, SIGMA must be a real scalar and the singular values closest to SIGMA are found.  As a corollary, `SIGMA = 0' finds the smallest singular values.  Note that for relatively small values of SIGMA, there is a chance that the requested number of singular values will not be found.  In that case SIGMA should be increased.

     OPTS is a structure defining options that `svds' will pass to `eigs'.  The possible fields of this structure are documented in `eigs'.  By default, `svds' sets the following three fields:

    `tol'
          The required convergence tolerance for the singular values.  The default value is 1e-10.  `eigs' is passed `TOL / sqrt(2)'.

    `maxit'
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

    `disp'
          The level of diagnostic printout (0|1|2).  If `disp' is 0 then diagnostics are disabled.  The default value is 0.

     If more than one output is requested then `svds' will return an approximation of the singular value decomposition of A

          A_approx = U*S*V'

     where A_approx is a matrix of size A but only rank K.

     FLAG returns 0 if the algorithm has succesfully converged, and 1 otherwise.  The test for convergence is

          norm (A*V - U*S, 1) <= TOL * norm (A, 1)

     `svds' is best for finding only a few singular values from a large sparse matrix.  Otherwise, `svd (full(A))' will likely be more efficient.

    `besselk'
          Modified Bessel functions of the second kind.  If the argument OPT is supplied, the result is multiplied by `exp(x)'.

    `besselh'
          Compute Hankel functions of the first (K = 1) or second (K = 2) kind.  If the argument OPT is supplied, the result is multiplied by `exp (-I*X)' for K = 1 or `exp (I*X)' for K = 2.

     If ALPHA is a scalar, the result is the same size as X.  If X is a scalar, the result is the same size as ALPHA.  If ALPHA is a row vector and X is a column vector, the result is a matrix with `length (X)' rows and `length (ALPHA)' columns.  Otherwise, ALPHA and X must conform and the result will be the same size.

     The value of ALPHA must be real.  The value of X may be complex.

     If requested, IERR contains the following status information and is the same size as the result.

       0. Normal return.

       1. Input error, return `NaN'.

       2. Overflow, return `Inf'.

       3. Loss of significance by argument reduction results in less than half of machine accuracy.

       4. Complete loss of significance by argument reduction, return `NaN'.

     Compute the Legendre function of degree N and order M = 0 ... N.  The optional argument, NORMALIZATION, may be one of `"unnorm"', `"sch"', or `"norm"'.  The default is `"unnorm"'.  The value of N must be a non-negative scalar integer.

     If the optional argument NORMALIZATION is missing or is `"unnorm"', compute the Legendre function of degree N and order M and return all values for M = 0 ... N.  The return value has one dimension more than X.

     The Legendre Function of degree N and order M:

           m        m       2  m/2   d^m
          P(x) = (-1) * (1-x  )    * ----  P(x)
           n                         dx^m   n

     with Legendre polynomial of degree N:

                    1    d^n   2    n
          P(x) = ------ [----(x - 1) ]
           n     2^n n!  dx^n

     `legendre (3, [-1.0, -0.9, -0.8])' returns the matrix:

           x  |   -1.0   |   -0.9   |   -0.8
          ------------------------------------
          m=0 | -1.00000 | -0.47250 | -0.08000
          m=1 |  0.00000 | -1.99420 | -1.98000
          m=2 |  0.00000 | -2.56500 | -4.32000
          m=3 |  0.00000 | -1.24229 | -3.24000

     If the optional argument `normalization' is `"sch"', compute the Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre function.  The Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre function is related to the unnormalized Legendre functions by the following:

     For Legendre functions of degree n and order 0:

            0      0
          SP(x) = P(x)
            n      n

     For Legendre functions of degree n and order m:

            m      m         m    2(n-m)! 0.5
          SP(x) = P(x) * (-1)  * [-------]
            n      n              (n+m)!

     If the optional argument NORMALIZATION is `"norm"', compute the fully normalized associated Legendre function.  The fully normalized associated Legendre function is related to the unnormalized Legendre functions by the following:

     For Legendre functions of degree N and order M

            m      m         m    (n+0.5)(n-m)! 0.5
          NP(x) = P(x) * (-1)  * [-------------]

 -- Function File: C = nchoosek (N, K)
 -- Function File: C = nchoosek (SET, K)
     Compute the binomial coefficient or all combinations of a set of items.

     If N is a scalar then calculate the binomial coefficient of N and K which is defined as

           /   \
           | n |    n (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-k+1)       n!
           |   |  = ------------------------- =  ---------
           | k |               k!                k! (n-k)!
           \   /

     This is the number of combinations of N items taken in groups of size K.

     If the first argument is a vector, SET, then generate all combinations of the elements of SET, taken K at a time, with one row per combination.  The result C has K columns and `nchoosek (length (SET), K)' rows.

     For example:

     How many ways can three items be grouped into pairs?

          nchoosek (3, 2)
             => 3

     What are the possible pairs?

          nchoosek (1:3, 2)
             =>  1   2
                 1   3
                 2   3

     `nchoosek' works only for non-negative, integer arguments.  Use `bincoeff' for non-integer and negative scalar arguments, or for computing many binomial coefficients at once with vector inputs for N or K.

     Construct a Hadamard matrix (Hn) of size N-by-N.  The size N must be of the form 2^k * p in which p is one of 1, 12, 20 or 28.  The returned matrix is normalized, meaning `Hn(:,1) == 1' and `Hn(1,:) == 1'.

     Some of the properties of Hadamard matrices are:

        * `kron (Hm, Hn)' is a Hadamard matrix of size M-by-N.

        * `Hn * Hn' = N * eye (N)'.

        * The rows of Hn are orthogonal.

        * `det (A) <= abs (det (Hn))' for all A with `abs (A(i, j)) <= 1'.

        * Multiplying any row or column by -1 and the matrix will remain a Hadamard matrix.

                          \ k-1 /   \k/

     The validity of this formula can easily be checked by expanding the binomial coefficients in both formulas as factorials.  It can be derived more directly via the theory of Cauchy matrices.  See J. W. Demmel, `Applied Numerical Linear Algebra', p. 92.

     Compare this with the numerical calculation of `inverse (hilb (n))', which suffers from the ill-conditioning of the Hilbert matrix, and the finite precision of your computer's floating point arithmetic.

     Produce histogram counts.

     When X is a vector, the function counts the number of elements of X that fall in the histogram bins defined by EDGES.  This must be a vector of monotonically increasing values that define the edges of the histogram bins.  `N(k)' contains the number of elements in X for which `EDGES(k) <= X < EDGES(k+1)'.  The final element of N contains the number of elements of X exactly equal to the last element of EDGES.

     When X is an N-dimensional array, the computation is carried out along dimension DIM.  If not specified DIM defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     When a second output argument is requested an index matrix is also returned.  The IDX matrix has the same size as X.  Each element of IDX contains the index of the histogram bin in which the corresponding element of X was counted.

     Compute Kendall's TAU.

     For two data vectors X, Y of common length N, Kendall's TAU is the correlation of the signs of all rank differences of X and Y; i.e., if both X and Y have distinct entries, then

                   1

     in which the Q(I) and R(I) are the ranks of X and Y, respectively.

     If X and Y are drawn from independent distributions, Kendall's TAU is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and variance `(2 * (2N+5)) / (9 * N * (N-1))'.

 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X)

 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P, DIM, METHOD)
     For a sample, X, calculate the quantiles, Q, corresponding to the cumulative probability values in P.  All non-numeric values (NaNs) of X are ignored.

     If X is a matrix, compute the quantiles for each column and return them in a matrix, such that the i-th row of Q contains the P(i)th quantiles of each column of X.

     If P is unspecified, return the quantiles for `[0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00]'.  The optional argument DIM determines the dimension along which the quantiles are calculated.  If DIM is omitted, and X is a vector or matrix, it defaults to 1 (column-wise quantiles).  If X is an N-D array, DIM defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     The methods available to calculate sample quantiles are the nine methods used by R (http://www.r-project.org/).  The default value is METHOD = 5.

     Discontinuous sample quantile methods 1, 2, and 3

       1. Method 1: Inverse of empirical distribution function.

       2. Method 2: Similar to method 1 but with averaging at discontinuities.

       3. Method 3: SAS definition: nearest even order statistic.

     Continuous sample quantile methods 4 through 9, where p(k) is the linear interpolation function respecting each methods' representative cdf.

       4. Method 4: p(k) = k / n.  That is, linear interpolation of the empirical cdf.

       5. Method 5: p(k) = (k - 0.5) / n.  That is a piecewise linear function where the knots are the values midway through the steps of the empirical cdf.

       6. Method 6: p(k) = k / (n + 1).

       7. Method 7: p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1).

       8. Method 8: p(k) = (k - 1/3) / (n + 1/3).  The resulting quantile estimates are approximately median-unbiased regardless of the distribution of X.

       9. Method 9: p(k) = (k - 3/8) / (n + 1/4).  The resulting quantile estimates are approximately unbiased for the expected order statistics if X is normally distributed.

     Hyndman and Fan (1996) recommend method 8.  Maxima, S, and R (versions prior to 2.0.0) use 7 as their default.  Minitab and SPSS use method 6.  MATLAB uses method 5.

 -- Function File: [THETA, BETA, DEV, DL, D2L, P] = logistic_regression (Y, X, PRINT, THETA, BETA)
     Perform ordinal logistic regression.

     Suppose Y takes values in K ordered categories, and let `gamma_i (X)' be the cumulative probability that Y falls in one of the first I categories given the covariate X.  Then

          [theta, beta] = logistic_regression (y, x)

     fits the model

          logit (gamma_i (x)) = theta_i - beta' * x,   i = 1 ... k-1

     The number of ordinal categories, K, is taken to be the number of distinct values of `round (Y)'.  If K equals 2, Y is binary and the model is ordinary logistic regression.  The matrix X is assumed to have full column rank.

     Given Y only, `theta = logistic_regression (y)' fits the model with baseline logit odds only.

     The full form is

          [theta, beta, dev, dl, d2l, gamma]
             = logistic_regression (y, x, print, theta, beta)

     in which all output arguments and all input arguments except Y are optional.

     Setting PRINT to 1 requests summary information about the fitted model to be displayed.  Setting PRINT to 2 requests information about convergence at each iteration.  Other values request no information to be displayed.  The input arguments THETA and BETA give initial estimates for THETA and BETA.

     The returned value DEV holds minus twice the log-likelihood.

     The returned values DL and D2L are the vector of first and the matrix of second derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to THETA and BETA.

     P holds estimates for the conditional distribution of Y given X.

     Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The goal is to test whether the population means of data taken from K different groups are all equal.

     Data may be given in a single vector Y with groups specified by a corresponding vector of group labels G (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).  This is the general form which does not impose any restriction on the number of data in each group or the group labels.

     If Y is a matrix and G is omitted, each column of Y is treated as a group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced ANOVA in which the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

     Under the null of constant means, the statistic F follows an F distribution with DF_B and DF_W degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is returned in PVAL.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, K, DF] = kruskal_wallis_test (X1, ...)
     Perform a Kruskal-Wallis one-factor "analysis of variance".

     Suppose a variable is observed for K > 1 different groups, and let X1, ..., XK be the corresponding data vectors.

     Under the null hypothesis that the ranks in the pooled sample are not affected by the group memberships, the test statistic K is approximately chi-square with DF = K - 1 degrees of freedom.

     If the data contains ties (some value appears more than once) K is divided by

     1 - SUM_TIES / (N^3 - N)

     where SUM_TIES is the sum of T^2 - T over each group of ties where T is the number of ties in the group and N is the total number of values in the input data.  For more info on this adjustment see "Use of Ranks in One-Criterion Variance Analysis" in Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 47, No. 260 (Dec 1952) by William H. Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at K) is returned in PVAL.

 -- Function File: S = mat2str (X, N)
 -- Function File: S = mat2str (X, N, "class")
     Format real, complex, and logical matrices as strings.  The returned string may be used to reconstruct the original matrix by using the `eval' function.

     The precision of the values is given by N.  If N is a scalar then both real and imaginary parts of the matrix are printed to the same precision.  Otherwise `N(1)' defines the precision of the real part and `N(2)' defines the precision of the imaginary part.  The default for N is 15.

     If the argument "class" is given then the class of X is included in the string in such a way that `eval' will result in the construction of a matrix of the same class.

          mat2str ([ -1/3 + i/7; 1/3 - i/7 ], [4 2])
               => "[-0.3333+0.14i;0.3333-0.14i]"

 -- Function File:  regexptranslate (OP, S)
     Translate a string for use in a regular expression.  This may include either wildcard replacement or special character escaping.  The behavior is controlled by OP which can take the following values

    "wildcard"
          The wildcard characters `.', `*', and `?' are replaced with wildcards that are appropriate for a regular expression.  For example:

               regexptranslate ("wildcard", "*.m")
                    => ".*\.m"

    "escape"
          The characters `$.?[]', that have special meaning for regular expressions are escaped so that they are treated literally.  For example:

               regexptranslate ("escape", "12.5")
                    => "12\.5"

 -- Function File:  rindex (S, T)
     Return the position of the last occurrence of the character string T in the character string S, or 0 if no occurrence is found.  S may also be a string array or cell array of strings.

     For example:

          rindex ("Teststring", "t")
               => 6

     The `rindex' function is equivalent to `index' with DIRECTION set to `"last"'.

 -- Function File: [CSTR] = strsplit (S, SEP)
 -- Function File: [CSTR] = strsplit (S, SEP, STRIP_EMPTY)
     Split the string S using one or more separators SEP and return a cell array of strings.  Consecutive separators and separators at boundaries result in empty strings, unless STRIP_EMPTY is true.  The default value of STRIP_EMPTY is false.

     2-D character arrays are split at separators and at the original column boundaries.

     Example:

          strsplit ("a,b,c", ",")
                =>
                    {
                      [1,1] = a

 -- Function File: X = str2num (S)
 -- Function File: [X, STATE] = str2num (S)
     Convert the string (or character array) S to a number (or an array).  Examples:

          str2num ("3.141596")
                => 3.141596

          str2num (["1, 2, 3"; "4, 5, 6"])
                => 1  2  3
                   4  5  6

     The optional second output, STATE, is logically true when the conversion is successful.  If the conversion fails the numeric output, X, is empty and STATE is false.

     *Caution:* As `str2num' uses the `eval' function to do the conversion, `str2num' will execute any code contained in the string S.  Use `str2double' for a safer and faster conversion.

     For cell array of strings use `str2double'.

 -- Function File:  strcat (S1, S2, ...)
     Return a string containing all the arguments concatenated horizontally.  If the arguments are cells strings,  `strcat' returns a cell string with the individual cells concatenated.  For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  Trailing white space is eliminated.  For example:

          s = [ "ab"; "cde" ];
          strcat (s, s, s)
              =>
                  "ab ab ab "

 -- Function File:  strmatch (S, A, "exact")
     Return indices of entries of A which begin with the string S.  The second argument A must be a string, character matrix, or a cell array of strings.  If the third argument `"exact"' is not given, then S only needs to match A up to the length of S.  Trailing spaces and nulls in S and A are ignored when matching.

     For example:

          strmatch ("apple", "apple juice")
               => 1

          strmatch ("apple", ["apple  "; "apple juice"; "an apple"])

 -- Function File: [TOK, REM] = strtok (STR)
 -- Function File: [TOK, REM] = strtok (STR, DELIM)
     Find all characters in the string STR up to, but not including, the first character which is in the string DELIM.  If REM is requested, it contains the remainder of the string, starting at the first delimiter.  Leading delimiters are ignored.  If DELIM is not specified, whitespace is assumed.  STR may also be a cell array of strings in which case the function executes on every individual string and returns a cell array of tokens and remainders.

     Examples:

          strtok ("this is the life")

 -- Function File:  substr (S, OFFSET)
 -- Function File:  substr (S, OFFSET, LEN)
     Return the substring of S which starts at character number OFFSET and is LEN characters long.

     Position numbering for offsets begins with 1.  If OFFSET is negative, extraction starts that far from the end of the string.

     If LEN is omitted, the substring extends to the end of S.  A negative value for LEN extracts to within LEN characters of the end of the string

     Examples:

          substr ("This is a test string", 6, 9)
               => "is a test"
          substr ("This is a test string", -11)

     Replace TAB characters in T, with spaces.  The tab width is specified by TW, or defaults to eight.  The input, T, may be either a 2-D character array, or a cell array of character strings.  The output is the same class as the input.

     If the optional argument DEBLANK is true, then the spaces will be removed from the end of the character data.

     The following example reads a file and writes an untabified version of the same file with trailing spaces stripped.

 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (STR, STRARRAY)
 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (STR, STRARRAY, FUNCNAME)
 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (STR, STRARRAY, FUNCNAME, VARNAME)
 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (..., POSITION)
     Verify that STR is an element, or substring of an element, in STRARRAY.

     When STR is a character string to be tested, and STRARRAY is a cellstr of valid values, then VALIDSTR will be the validated form of STR where validation is defined as STR being a member or substring of VALIDSTR.  This is useful for both verifying and expanding short options, such as "r", to their longer forms, such as "red".  If STR is a substring of VALIDSTR, and there are multiple matches, the shortest match will be returned if all matches are substrings of each other.  Otherwise, an error will be raised because the expansion of STR is ambiguous.  All comparisons are case insensitive.

     The additional inputs FUNCNAME, VARNAME, and POSITION are optional and will make any generated validation error message more specific.

     Examples:

          validatestring ("r", {"red", "green", "blue"})
          => "red"

          validatestring ("b", {"red", "green", "blue", "black"})
          => error: validatestring: multiple unique matches were found for 'b':
             blue, black

     Produce an error if the specified condition is not met.  `assert' can be called in three different ways.

    `assert (COND)'
    `assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)'
    `assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)'
          Called with a single argument COND, `assert' produces an error if COND is zero.  When called with more than one argument the additional arguments are passed to the `error' function.

    `assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)'
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected.  Note that OBSERVED and EXPECTED can be scalars, vectors, matrices, strings, cell arrays, or structures.

    `assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)'
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected but equality comparison for numeric data uses a tolerance TOL.  If TOL is positive then it is an absolute tolerance which will produce an error if `abs(OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs(TOL)'.  If TOL is negative then it is a relative tolerance which will produce an error if `abs(OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs(TOL * EXPECTED)'.  If EXPECTED is zero TOL will always be interpreted as an absolute tolerance.

 -- Command:  demo NAME
 -- Command:  demo NAME N
 -- Function File:  demo ("NAME")
 -- Function File:  demo ("NAME", N)
     Run example code block N associated with the function NAME.  If N is not specified, all examples are run.

     Examples are stored in the script file, or in a file with the same name but no extension located on Octave's load path.  To keep examples separate from regular script code, all lines are prefixed by `%!'.  Each example must also be introduced by the keyword 'demo' flush left to the prefix with no intervening spaces.  The remainder of the example can contain arbitrary Octave code.  For example:

          %!demo
          %! t = 0:0.01:2*pi;
          %! x = sin (t);
          %! plot (t, x);
          %! %-------------------------------------------------
          %! % the figure window shows one cycle of a sine wave

     Note that the code is displayed before it is executed, so a simple comment at the end suffices for labeling what is being shown.  It is generally not necessary to use `disp' or `printf' within the demo.

     Demos are run in a function environment with no access to external variables.  This means that every demo must have separate initialization code.  Alternatively, all demos can be combined into a single large demo with the code

          %! input("Press <enter> to continue: ","s");

     between the sections, but this is discouraged.  Other techniques to avoid multiple initialization blocks include using multiple plots with a new `figure' command between each plot, or using `subplot' to put multiple plots in the same window.

     Also, because demo evaluates within a function context, you cannot define new functions inside a demo.  If you must have function blocks, rather than just anonymous functions or inline functions, you will have to use `eval(example("function",n))' to see them.  Because eval only evaluates one line, or one statement if the statement crosses multiple lines, you must wrap your demo in "if 1 <demo stuff> endif" with the 'if' on the same line as 'demo'.  For example:

          %!demo if 1
          %!  function y=f(x)
          %!    y=x;
          %!  endfunction
          %!  f(3)
          %! endif

 -- Function File:  speed (F, INIT, MAX_N, F2, TOL)
 -- Function File: [ORDER, N, T_F, T_F2] = speed (...)
     Determine the execution time of an expression (F) for various input values (N).  The N are log-spaced from 1 to MAX_N.  For each N, an initialization expression (INIT) is computed to create any data needed for the test.  If a second expression (F2) is given then the execution times of the two expressions are compared.  When called without output arguments the results are printed to stdout and displayed graphically.

    `F'
          The code expression to evaluate.

    `MAX_N'
          The maximum test length to run.  The default value is 100.  Alternatively, use `[min_n, max_n]' or specify the N exactly with `[n1, n2, ..., nk]'.

    `INIT'
          Initialization expression for function argument values.  Use K for the test number and N for the size of the test.  This should compute values for all variables used by F.  Note that INIT will be evaluated first for k = 0, so things which are constant throughout the test series can be computed once.  The default value is `X = randn (N, 1)'.

    `F2'
          An alternative expression to evaluate, so that the speed of two expressions can be directly compared.  The default is `[]'.

    `TOL'
          Tolerance used to compare the results of expression F and expression F2.  If TOL is positive, the tolerance is an absolute one.  If TOL is negative, the tolerance is a relative one.  The default is `eps'.  If TOL is `Inf', then no comparison will be made.

    `ORDER'
          The time complexity of the expression O(a*n^p).  This is a structure with fields `a' and `p'.

    `N'
          The values N for which the expression was calculated *AND* the execution time was greater than zero.

    `T_F'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F in seconds.

    `T_F2'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F2 in seconds.  If required, the mean time ratio is simply `mean (T_f ./ T_f2)'.


     The slope of the execution time graph shows the approximate power of the asymptotic running time O(n^p).  This power is plotted for the region over which it is approximated (the latter half of the graph).  The estimated power is not very accurate, but should be sufficient to determine the general order of an algorithm.  It should indicate if, for example, the implementation is unexpectedly O(n^2) rather than O(n) because it extends a vector each time through the loop rather than pre-allocating storage.  In the current version of Octave, the following is not the expected O(n).

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", "", [1000, 10000])

     But it is if you preallocate the cell array `y':

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", ...
                 "x = rand (n, 1); y = cell (size (x));", [1000, 10000])

     An attempt is made to approximate the cost of individual operations, but it is wildly inaccurate.  You can improve the stability somewhat by doing more work for each `n'.  For example:

          speed ("airy(x)", "x = rand (n, 10)", [10000, 100000])

     When comparing two different expressions (F, F2), the slope of the line on the speedup ratio graph should be larger than 1 if the new expression is faster.  Better algorithms have a shallow slope.  Generally, vectorizing an algorithm will not change the slope of the execution time graph, but will shift it relative to the original.  For example:

          speed ("sum (x)", "", [10000, 100000], ...
                 "v = 0; for i = 1:length (x), v += x(i); endfor")

     The following is a more complex example.  If there was an original version of `xcorr' using for loops and a second version using an FFT, then one could compare the run speed for various lags as follows, or for a fixed lag with varying vector lengths as follows:

          speed ("xcorr (x, n)", "x = rand (128, 1);", 100,
                 "xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)
          speed ("xcorr (x, 15)", "x = rand (20+n, 1);", 100,
                 "xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)

     Assuming one of the two versions is in xcorr_orig, this would compare their speed and their output values.  Note that the FFT version is not exact, so one must specify an acceptable tolerance on the comparison `100*eps'.  In this case, the comparison should be computed relatively, as `abs ((X - Y) ./ Y)' rather than absolutely as `abs (X - Y)'.

     Type `example ("speed")' to see some real examples or `demo ("speed")' to run them.

     Perform tests from the first file in the loadpath matching NAME.  `test' can be called as a command or as a function.  Called with a single argument NAME, the tests are run interactively and stop after the first error is encountered.

     With a second argument the tests which are performed and the amount of output is selected.

    "quiet"
          Don't report all the tests as they happen, just the errors.

    "normal"
          Report all tests as they happen, but don't do tests which require user interaction.

    "verbose"
          Do tests which require user interaction.

     The argument FID can be used to allow batch processing.  Errors can be written to the already open file defined by FID, and hopefully when Octave crashes this file will tell you what was happening when it did.  You can use `stdout' if you want to see the results as they happen.  You can also give a file name rather than an FID, in which case the contents of the file will be replaced with the log from the current test.

     Called with a single output argument SUCCESS, `test' returns true if all of the tests were successful.  Called with two output arguments N and MAX, the number of successful tests and the total number of tests in the file NAME are returned.

     If the second argument is the string "grabdemo", the contents of the demo blocks are extracted but not executed.  Code for all code blocks is concatenated and returned as CODE with IDX being a vector of positions of the ends of the demo blocks.

     If the second argument is "explain", then NAME is ignored and an explanation of the line markers used is written to the file FID.

     If F is not specified or is `-1', then use 0, 1 or 16, depending on whether the date portion or the time portion of DATE is empty.

     If P is nor specified, it defaults to the current year minus 50.

     If a matrix or cell array of dates is given, a column vector of date strings is returned.

     Add date formatted tick labels to an axis.  The axis the apply the ticks to is determined by AXIS that can take the values "x", "y" or "z".  The default value is "x".  The formatting of the labels is determined by the variable FORM, that can either be a string in the format needed by `dateform', or a positive integer that can be accepted by `datestr'.

     Convert a serial date number (see `datenum') or date string (see `datestr') into a date vector.

     A date vector is a row vector with six members, representing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds respectively.

     F is the format string used to interpret date strings (see `datestr').  If DATE is a string, but no format is specified, then a relatively slow search is performed through various formats.  It is always preferable to specifiy the format string F if it is known.  Formats which do not specify a particular time component will have the value set to zero.  Formats which do not specify a date will default to January 1st of the current year.

     P is the year at the start of the century to which two-digit years will be referenced.  If not specified, it defaults to the current year minus 50.

 -- Built-in Function:  cat (DIM, ARRAY1, ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN)
     Return the concatenation of N-D array objects, ARRAY1, ARRAY2, ..., ARRAYN along dimension DIM.

          A = ones (2, 2);
          B = zeros (2, 2);
          cat (2, A, B)
            => 1 1 0 0
               1 1 0 0

     Alternatively, we can concatenate A and B along the second dimension in the following way:

          [A, B]

     DIM can be larger than the dimensions of the N-D array objects and the result will thus have DIM dimensions as the following example shows:

          cat (4, ones (2, 2), zeros (2, 2))
            => ans(:,:,1,1) =

                 1 1
                 1 1

               ans(:,:,1,2) =

     Return the number of elements in the object A.  Optionally, if indices IDX1, IDX2, ... are supplied, return the number of elements that would result from the indexing

          A(IDX1, IDX2, ...)

     Note that the indices do not have to be numerical.  For example,

          A = 1;
          B = ones (2, 3);
          numel (A, B)

     will return 6, as this is the number of ways to index with B.

     This method is also called when an object appears as lvalue with cs-list indexing, i.e., `object{...}' or `object(...).field'.

 -- Built-in Function:  size (A)
 -- Built-in Function:  size (A, DIM)
     Return the number of rows and columns of A.

     With one input argument and one output argument, the result is returned in a row vector.  If there are multiple output arguments, the number of rows is assigned to the first, and the number of columns to the second, etc.  For example:

          size ([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6])
             => [ 3, 2 ]

          [nr, nc] = size ([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6])
              => nr = 3
              => nc = 2

     If given a second argument, `size' will return the size of the corresponding dimension.  For example,

          size ([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6], 2)
              => 2

     returns the number of columns in the given matrix.

 -- Built-in Function:  sum (X, DIM)
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (..., "native")
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (..., "double")
 -- Built-in Function:  sum (..., "extra")
     Sum of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     If the optional argument "native" is given, then the sum is performed in the same type as the original argument, rather than in the default double type.  For example:

          sum ([true, true])
             => 2
          sum ([true, true], "native")
             => true

     On the contrary, if "double" is given, the sum is performed in double precision even for single precision inputs.

     For double precision inputs, "extra" indicates that a more accurate algorithm than straightforward summation is to be used.  For single precision inputs, "extra" is the same as "double".  Otherwise, "extra" has no effect.

     but it uses less memory and avoids calling `conj' if X is real.

     Return a scalar, matrix, or N-dimensional array whose elements are all equal to the IEEE symbol NaN (Not a Number).  NaN is the result of operations which do not produce a well defined numerical result.  Common operations which produce a NaN are arithmetic with infinity (Inf - Inf), zero divided by zero (0/0), and any operation involving another NaN value (5 + NaN).

     Note that NaN always compares not equal to NaN (NaN != NaN).  This behavior is specified by the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic.  To find NaN values, use the `isnan' function.

     When called with no arguments, return a scalar with the value `NaN'.  When called with a single argument, return a square matrix with the dimension specified.  When called with more than one scalar argument the first two arguments are taken as the number of rows and columns and any further arguments specify additional matrix dimensions.

     Return an identity matrix.  If invoked with a single scalar argument N, return a square NxN identity matrix.  If supplied two scalar arguments (M, N), `eye' takes them to be the number of rows and columns.  If given a vector with two elements, `eye' uses the values of the elements as the number of rows and columns, respectively.  For example:

          eye (3)
           =>  1  0  0
               0  1  0
               0  0  1

     The following expressions all produce the same result:

          eye (2)
          ==
          eye (2, 2)
          ==
          eye (size ([1, 2; 3, 4])

     The optional argument CLASS, allows `eye' to return an array of the specified type, like

          val = zeros (n,m, "uint8")

     Calling `eye' with no arguments is equivalent to calling it with an argument of 1.  Any negative dimensions are treated as zero.  These odd definitions are for compatibility with MATLAB.

     Return a row vector with N linearly spaced elements between BASE and LIMIT.  If the number of elements is greater than one, then the endpoints BASE and LIMIT are always included in the range.  If BASE is greater than LIMIT, the elements are stored in decreasing order.  If the number of points is not specified, a value of 100 is used.

     The `linspace' function always returns a row vector if both BASE and LIMIT are scalars.  If one, or both, of them are column vectors, `linspace' returns a matrix.

     For compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument (LIMIT) if fewer than two values are requested.

     Resize X cutting off elements as necessary.

     In the result, element with certain indices is equal to the corresponding element of X if the indices are within the bounds of X; otherwise, the element is set to zero.

     In other words, the statement

          y = resize (x, dv)

     is equivalent to the following code:

          y = zeros (dv, class (x));
          sz = min (dv, size (x));
          for i = 1:length (sz)
            idx{i} = 1:sz(i);
          endfor
          y(idx{:}) = x(idx{:});

     but is performed more efficiently.

     If only M is supplied, and it is a scalar, the dimension of the result is M-by-M.  If M, N, ... are all scalars, then the dimensions of the result are M-by-N-by-....  If given a vector as input, then the dimensions of the result are given by the elements of that vector.

     An object can be resized to more dimensions than it has; in such case the missing dimensions are assumed to be 1.  Resizing an object to fewer dimensions is not possible.

     Return a matrix with the specified dimensions (M, N, ...)  whose elements are taken from the matrix A.  The elements of the matrix are accessed in column-major order (like Fortran arrays are stored).

     The following code demonstrates reshaping a 1x4 row vector into a 2x2 square matrix.

          reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)

                    2  4

     Note that the total number of elements in the original matrix (`prod (size (A))') must match the total number of elements in the new matrix (`prod ([M N ...])').

     A single dimension of the return matrix may be left unspecified and Octave will determine its size automatically.  An empty matrix ([]) is used to flag the unspecified dimension.

     Compute the p-norm of the matrix A.  If the second argument is missing, `p = 2' is assumed.

     If A is a matrix (or sparse matrix):

    P = `1'
          1-norm, the largest column sum of the absolute values of A.

    P = `2'
          Largest singular value of A.

    other P, `P > 1'
          maximum `norm (A*x, p)' such that `norm (x, p) == 1'

     If A is a vector or a scalar:

    P = `Inf' or `"inf"'
          `max (abs (A))'.

    P = `-Inf'
          `min (abs (A))'.

    P = `"fro"'
          Frobenius norm of A, `sqrt (sumsq (abs (A)))'.

    P = 0
          Hamming norm - the number of nonzero elements.

    other P, `P > 1'
          p-norm of A, `(sum (abs (A) .^ P)) ^ (1/P)'.

    other P `P < 1'
          the p-pseudonorm defined as above.

     If OPT is the value `"rows"', treat each row as a vector and compute its norm.  The result is returned as a column vector.  Similarly, if OPT is `"columns"' or `"cols"' then compute the norms of each column and return a row vector.

 -- Built-in Function:  toc ()
 -- Built-in Function:  toc (ID)
 -- Built-in Function: VAL = toc (...)
     Set or check a wall-clock timer.  Calling `tic' without an output argument sets the internal timer state.  Subsequent calls to `toc' return the number of seconds since the timer was set.  For example,

          tic ();
          # many computations later...
          elapsed_time = toc ();

     will set the variable `elapsed_time' to the number of seconds since the most recent call to the function `tic'.

     If called with one output argument, `tic' returns a scalar of type `uint64' that may be later passed to `toc'.

          id = tic; sleep (5); toc (id)
                => 5.0010

     Calling `tic' and `toc' this way allows nested timing calls.

     If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used, you should use the `cputime' function instead.  The `tic' and `toc' functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other jobs or doing nothing at all.

     Return the CPU time used by your Octave session.  The first output is the total time spent executing your process and is equal to the sum of second and third outputs, which are the number of CPU seconds spent executing in user mode and the number of CPU seconds spent executing in system mode, respectively.  If your system does not have a way to report CPU time usage, `cputime' returns 0 for each of its output values.  Note that because Octave used some CPU time to start, it is reasonable to check to see if `cputime' works by checking to see if the total CPU time used is nonzero.

 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X, DIM)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X, MODE)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, I] = sort (X, DIM, MODE)
     Return a copy of X with the elements arranged in increasing order.  For matrices, `sort' orders the elements within columns

     For example:

          sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
             =>  1  1
                 2  2
                 3  3

     If the optional argument DIM is given, then the matrix is sorted along the dimension defined by DIM.  The optional argument `mode' defines the order in which the values will be sorted.  Valid values of `mode' are "ascend" or "descend".

     The `sort' function may also be used to produce a matrix containing the original row indices of the elements in the sorted matrix.  For example:

          [s, i] = sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
            => s = 1  1
                   2  2
                   3  3
            => i = 1  3
                   2  1
                   3  2

     For equal elements, the indices are such that equal elements are listed in the order in which they appeared in the original list.

     Sorting of complex entries is done first by magnitude (`abs (Z)') and for any ties by phase angle (`angle (z)').  For example:

          sort ([1+i; 1; 1-i])
              => 1 + 0i
                 1 - 1i
                 1 + 1i

     NaN values are treated as being greater than any other value and are sorted to the end of the list.

     The `sort' function may also be used to sort strings and cell arrays of strings, in which case ASCII dictionary order (uppercase 'A' precedes lowercase 'a') of the strings is used.

     The algorithm used in `sort' is optimized for the sorting of partially ordered lists.

 -- Built-in Function:  issorted (A)

 -- Built-in Function:  issorted (A, "rows", MODE)
     Return true if the array is sorted according to MODE, which may be either "ascending", "descending", or "either".  By default,  MODE is "ascending".  NaNs are treated in the same manner as `sort'.

     If the optional argument "rows" is supplied, check whether the array is sorted by rows as output by the function `sortrows' (with no options).

     This function does not support sparse matrices.

     *See also:* sort, sortrows.

 -- Built-in Function:  nth_element (X, N)
 -- Built-in Function:  nth_element (X, N, DIM)
     Select the n-th smallest element of a vector, using the ordering defined by `sort'.  In other words, the result is equivalent to `sort(X)(N)'.  N can also be a contiguous range, either ascending `l:u' or descending `u:-1:l', in which case a range of elements is returned.  If X is an array, `nth_element' operates along the dimension defined by DIM, or the first non-singleton dimension if DIM is not given.

     nth_element encapsulates the C++ standard library algorithms nth_element and partial_sort.  On average, the complexity of the operation is O(M*log(K)), where `M = size (X, DIM)' and `K = length (N)'.  This function is intended for cases where the ratio K/M is small; otherwise, it may be better to use `sort'.

 -- Built-in Function:  merge (MASK, TVAL, FVAL)
 -- Built-in Function:  ifelse (MASK, TVAL, FVAL)
     Merge elements of TRUE_VAL and FALSE_VAL, depending on the value of MASK.  If MASK is a logical scalar, the other two arguments can be arbitrary values.  Otherwise, MASK must be a logical array, and TVAL, FVAL should be arrays of matching class, or cell arrays.  In the scalar mask case, TVAL is returned if MASK is true, otherwise FVAL is returned.

     In the array mask case, both TVAL and FVAL must be either scalars or arrays with dimensions equal to MASK.  The result is constructed as follows:

          result(mask) = tval(mask);
          result(! mask) = fval(! mask);

     MASK can also be arbitrary numeric type, in which case it is first converted to logical.

 -- Built-in Function:  diff (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  diff (X, K)
 -- Built-in Function:  diff (X, K, DIM)
     If X is a vector of length n, `diff (X)' is the vector of first differences  X(2) - X(1), ..., X(n) - X(n-1).

     If X is a matrix, `diff (X)' is the matrix of column differences along the first non-singleton dimension.

     The second argument is optional.  If supplied, `diff (X, K)', where K is a non-negative integer, returns the K-th differences.  It is possible that K is larger than the first non-singleton dimension of the matrix.  In this case, `diff' continues to take the differences along the next non-singleton dimension.

     The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly stated with the optional variable DIM.  In this case the K-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.  In the case where K exceeds `size (X, DIM)' an empty matrix is returned.

# name: <cell-element>

 -- Built-in Function:  repelems (X, R)
     Construct a vector of repeated elements from X.  R is a 2xN integer matrix specifying which elements to repeat and how often to repeat each element.

     Entries in the first row, R(1,j), select an element to repeat.  The corresponding entry in the second row, R(2,j), specifies the repeat count.  If X is a matrix then the columns of X are imagined to be stacked on top of each other for purposes of the selection index.  A row vector is always returned.

     Conceptually the result is calculated as follows:

          y = [];
          for i = 1:columns (R)
            y = [y, X(R(1,i)*ones(1, R(2,i)))];

 -- Built-in Function:  glob (PATTERN)
     Given an array of pattern strings (as a char array or a cell array) in PATTERN, return a cell array of file names that match any of them, or an empty cell array if no patterns match.  The pattern strings are interpreted as filename globbing patterns (as they are used by Unix shells).  Within a pattern

    `*'
          matches any string, including the null string,

    `?'
          matches any single character, and

    `[...]'
          matches any of the enclosed characters.

     Tilde expansion is performed on each of the patterns before looking for matching file names.  For example:

          ls
             =>
                file1  file2  file3  myfile1 myfile1b
          glob ("*file1")

 -- Built-in Function:  error (TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  error (ID, TEMPLATE, ...)
     Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string TEMPLATE using the same rules as the `printf' family of functions (*note Formatted Output::) and print the resulting message on the `stderr' stream.  The message is prefixed by the character string `error: '.

     Calling `error' also sets Octave's internal error state such that control will return to the top level without evaluating any more commands.  This is useful for aborting from functions or scripts.

     If the error message does not end with a new line character, Octave will print a traceback of all the function calls leading to the error.  For example, given the following function definitions:

          function f () g (); end
          function g () h (); end
          function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1"); end

     calling the function `f' will result in a list of messages that can help you to quickly locate the exact location of the error:

          f ()
          error: nargin != 1
          error: called from:
          error:   error at line -1, column -1
          error:   h at line 1, column 27
          error:   g at line 1, column 15
          error:   f at line 1, column 15

     If the error message ends in a new line character, Octave will print the message but will not display any traceback messages as it returns control to the top level.  For example, modifying the error message in the previous example to end in a new line causes Octave to only print a single message:

          function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1\n"); end
          f ()
          error: nargin != 1

 -- Built-in Function:  warning ("error", ID)
     Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string TEMPLATE using the same rules as the `printf' family of functions (*note Formatted Output::) and print the resulting message on the `stderr' stream.  The message is prefixed by the character string `warning: '.  You should use this function when you want to notify the user of an unusual condition, but only when it makes sense for your program to go on.

     The optional message identifier allows users to enable or disable warnings tagged by ID.  The special identifier `"all"' may be used to set the state of all warnings.

     If the first argument is `"on"' or `"off"', set the state of a particular warning using the identifier ID.  If the first argument is `"query"', query the state of this warning instead.  If the identifier is omitted, a value of `"all"' is assumed.  If you set the state of a warning to `"error"', the warning named by ID is handled as if it were an error instead.  So, for example, the following handles all warnings as errors:

          warning ("error");

 -- Built-in Function:  usage (MSG)
     Print the message MSG, prefixed by the string `usage: ', and set Octave's internal error state such that control will return to the top level without evaluating any more commands.  This is useful for aborting from functions.

     After `usage' is evaluated, Octave will print a traceback of all the function calls leading to the usage message.

     You should use this function for reporting problems errors that result from an improper call to a function, such as calling a function with an incorrect number of arguments, or with arguments of the wrong type.  For example, most functions distributed with Octave begin with code like this

          if (nargin != 2)
            usage ("foo (a, b)");
          endif

     to check for the proper number of arguments.

     Read and skip COUNT lines from the file descriptor FID.  `fskipl' discards characters until an end-of-line is encountered exactly COUNT-times, or until the end-of-file marker is found.

     If COUNT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  COUNT may also be `Inf', in which case lines are skipped until the end of the file.  This form is suitable for counting the number of lines in a file.

     Returns the number of lines skipped (end-of-line sequences encountered).

 -- Built-in Function: [FID, MSG] = fopen (NAME, MODE, ARCH)
 -- Built-in Function: FID_LIST = fopen ("all")
 -- Built-in Function: [FILE, MODE, ARCH] = fopen (FID)
     The first form of the `fopen' function opens the named file with the specified mode (read-write, read-only, etc.) and architecture interpretation (IEEE big endian, IEEE little endian, etc.), and returns an integer value that may be used to refer to the file later.  If an error occurs, FID is set to -1 and MSG contains the corresponding system error message.  The MODE is a one or two character string that specifies whether the file is to be opened for reading, writing, or both.

     The second form of the `fopen' function returns a vector of file ids corresponding to all the currently open files, excluding the `stdin', `stdout', and `stderr' streams.

     The third form of the `fopen' function returns information about the open file given its file id.

     For example,

          myfile = fopen ("splat.dat", "r", "ieee-le");

     opens the file `splat.dat' for reading.  If necessary, binary numeric values will be read assuming they are stored in IEEE format with the least significant bit first, and then converted to the native representation.

     Opening a file that is already open simply opens it again and returns a separate file id.  It is not an error to open a file several times, though writing to the same file through several different file ids may produce unexpected results.

     The possible values `mode' may have are

    `r'
          Open a file for reading.

    `w'
          Open a file for writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

    `a'
          Open or create a file for writing at the end of the file.

    `r+'
          Open an existing file for reading and writing.

    `w+'
          Open a file for reading or writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

    `a+'
          Open or create a file for reading or writing at the end of the file.

     Append a "t" to the mode string to open the file in text mode or a "b" to open in binary mode.  On Windows and Macintosh systems, text mode reading and writing automatically converts linefeeds to the appropriate line end character for the system (carriage-return linefeed on Windows, carriage-return on Macintosh).  The default if no mode is specified is binary mode.

     Additionally, you may append a "z" to the mode string to open a gzipped file for reading or writing.  For this to be successful, you must also open the file in binary mode.

     The parameter ARCH is a string specifying the default data format for the file.  Valid values for ARCH are:

          `native' The format of the current machine (this is the default).

          `ieee-be' IEEE big endian format.

          `ieee-le' IEEE little endian format.

          `vaxd' VAX D floating format.

          `vaxg' VAX G floating format.

          `cray' Cray floating format.

     however, conversions are currently only supported for `native' `ieee-be', and `ieee-le' formats.

     In the first form, read from FID according to TEMPLATE, returning the result in the matrix VAL.

     The optional argument SIZE specifies the amount of data to read and may be one of

    `Inf'
          Read as much as possible, returning a column vector.

    `NR'
          Read up to NR elements, returning a column vector.

    `[NR, Inf]'
          Read as much as possible, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

    `[NR, NC]'
          Read up to `NR * NC' elements, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

     If SIZE is omitted, a value of `Inf' is assumed.

     A string is returned if TEMPLATE specifies only character conversions.

     The number of items successfully read is returned in COUNT.

     If an error occurs, ERRMSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     In the second form, read from FID according to TEMPLATE, with each conversion specifier in TEMPLATE corresponding to a single scalar return value.  This form is more `C-like', and also compatible with previous versions of Octave.  The number of successful conversions is returned in COUNT.  It permits to explicitly specify a locale to take into account language specific features, such as decimal separator.  This operation restores the previous locales setting at the end of the conversion.

     The default precision is `"uchar"'.

     The PRECISION argument may also specify an optional repeat count.  For example, `32*single' causes `fread' to read a block of 32 single precision floating point numbers.  Reading in blocks is useful in combination with the SKIP argument.

     The PRECISION argument may also specify a type conversion.  For example, `int16=>int32' causes `fread' to read 16-bit integer values and return an array of 32-bit integer values.  By default, `fread' returns a double precision array.  The special form `*TYPE' is shorthand for `TYPE=>TYPE'.

     The conversion and repeat counts may be combined.  For example, the specification `32*single=>single' causes `fread' to read blocks of single precision floating point values and return an array of single precision values instead of the default array of double precision values.

     The optional argument SKIP specifies the number of bytes to skip after each element (or block of elements) is read.  If it is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.  If the final block read is not complete, the final skip is omitted.  For example,

          fread (f, 10, "3*single=>single", 8)

     will omit the final 8-byte skip because the last read will not be a complete block of 3 values.

     The optional argument ARCH is a string specifying the data format for the file.  Valid values are

    `"native"'
          The format of the current machine.

    `"ieee-be"'
          IEEE big endian.

    `"ieee-le"'
          IEEE little endian.

    `"vaxd"'
          VAX D floating format.

    `"vaxg"'
          VAX G floating format.

    `"cray"'
          Cray floating format.

     Conversions are currently only supported for `"ieee-be"' and `"ieee-le"' formats.

     The data read from the file is returned in VAL, and the number of values read is returned in `count'

     Return the file ID corresponding to a new temporary file with a unique name created from TEMPLATE.  The last six characters of TEMPLATE must be `XXXXXX' and these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.  The file is then created with mode read/write and permissions that are system dependent (on GNU/Linux systems, the permissions will be 0600 for versions of glibc 2.0.7 and later).  The file is opened in binary mode and with the `O_EXCL' flag.

     If the optional argument DELETE is supplied and is true, the file will be deleted automatically when Octave exits, or when the function `purge_tmp_files' is called.

     If successful, FID is a valid file ID, NAME is the name of the file, and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise, FID is -1, NAME is empty, and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     Set named property values for the graphics handle (or vector of graphics handles) H.  There are three ways how to give the property names and values:

        * as a comma separated list of PROPERTY, VALUE pairs

          Here, each PROPERTY is a string containing the property name, each VALUE is a value of the appropriate type for the property.

        * as a cell array of strings PROPERTIES containing property names and a cell array VALUES containing property values.

          In this case, the number of columns of VALUES must match the number of elements in PROPERTIES.  The first column of VALUES contains values for the first entry in PROPERTIES, etc.  The number of rows of VALUES must be 1 or match the number of elements of H.  In the first case, each handle in H will be assigned the same values.  In the latter case, the first handle in H will be assigned the values from the first row of VALUES and so on.

        * as a structure array PV

          Here, the field names of PV represent the property names, and the field values give the property values.  In contrast to the previous case, all elements of PV will be set in all handles in H independent of the dimensions of PV.

addlistener


# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string
# elements: 1
# length: 1093
 -- Built-in Function:  addlistener (H, PROP, FCN)
     Register FCN as listener for the property PROP of the graphics object H.  Property listeners are executed (in order of registration) when the property is set.  The new value is already available when the listeners are executed.

     PROP must be a string naming a valid property in H.

     FCN can be a function handle, a string or a cell array whose first element is a function handle.  If FCN is a function handle, the corresponding function should accept at least 2 arguments, that will be set to the object handle and the empty matrix respectively.  If FCN is a string, it must be any valid octave expression.  If FCN is a cell array, the first element must be a function handle with the same signature as described above.  The next elements of the cell array are passed as additional arguments to the function.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
          endfunction

     If FCN is not defined then all listener functions of PROP are removed.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);

 -- Built-in Function:  addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE)
 -- Built-in Function:  addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE, ARG, ...)
     Create a new property named NAME in graphics object H.  TYPE determines the type of the property to create.  ARGS usually contains the default value of the property, but additional arguments might be given, depending on the type of the property.

     The supported property types are:

    `string'
          A string property.  ARG contains the default string value.

    `any'
          An un-typed property.  This kind of property can hold any octave value.  ARGS contains the default value.

    `radio'
          A string property with a limited set of accepted values.  The first argument must be a string with all accepted values separated by a vertical bar ('|').  The default value can be marked by enclosing it with a '{' '}' pair.  The default value may also be given as an optional second string argument.

    `boolean'
          A boolean property.  This property type is equivalent to a radio property with "on|off" as accepted values.  ARG contains the default property value.

    `double'
          A scalar double property.  ARG contains the default value.

    `handle'
          A handle property.  This kind of property holds the handle of a graphics object.  ARG contains the default handle value.  When no default value is given, the property is initialized to the empty matrix.

    `data'
          A data (matrix) property.  ARG contains the default data value.  When no default value is given, the data is initialized to the empty matrix.

    `color'
          A color property.  ARG contains the default color value.  When no default color is given, the property is set to black.  An optional second string argument may be given to specify an additional set of accepted string values (like a radio property).

     TYPE may also be the concatenation of a core object type and a valid property name for that object type.  The property created then has the same characteristics as the referenced property (type, possible values, hidden state...).  This allows to clone an existing property into the graphics object H.

     Examples:

          addproperty ("my_property", gcf, "string", "a string value");
          addproperty ("my_radio", gcf, "radio", "val_1|val_2|{val_3}");
          addproperty ("my_style", gcf, "linelinestyle", "--");

 -- Built-in Function:  waitfor (..., "timeout", TIMEOUT)
     Suspend the execution of the current program until a condition is satisfied on the graphics handle H.  While the program is suspended graphics events are still being processed normally, allowing callbacks to modify the state of graphics objects.  This function is reentrant and can be called from a callback, while another `waitfor' call is pending at top-level.

     In the first form, program execution is suspended until the graphics object H is destroyed.  If the graphics handle is invalid, the function returns immediately.

     In the second form, execution is suspended until the graphics object is destroyed or the property named PROP is modified.  If the graphics handle is invalid or the property does not exist, the function returns immediately.

     In the third form, execution is suspended until the graphics object is destroyed or the property named PROP is set to VALUE.  The function `isequal' is used to compare property values.  If the graphics handle is invalid, the property does not exist or the property is already set to VALUE, the function returns immediately.

     An optional timeout can be specified using the property `timeout'.  This timeout value is the number of seconds to wait for the condition to be true.  TIMEOUT must be at least 1. If a smaller value is specified, a warning is issued and a value of 1 is used instead.  If the timeout value is not an integer, it is truncated towards 0.

     To define a condition on a property named `timeout', use the string `\timeout' instead.

     In all cases, typing CTRL-C stops program execution immediately.

 -- Built-in Function:  input (PROMPT)
 -- Built-in Function:  input (PROMPT, "s")
     Print a prompt and wait for user input.  For example,

          input ("Pick a number, any number! ")

     prints the prompt

          Pick a number, any number!

     and waits for the user to enter a value.  The string entered by the user is evaluated as an expression, so it may be a literal constant, a variable name, or any other valid expression.

     Currently, `input' only returns one value, regardless of the number of values produced by the evaluation of the expression.

     If you are only interested in getting a literal string value, you can call `input' with the character string `"s"' as the second argument.  This tells Octave to return the string entered by the user directly, without evaluating it first.

     Because there may be output waiting to be displayed by the pager, it is a good idea to always call `fflush (stdout)' before calling `input'.  This will ensure that all pending output is written to the screen before your prompt.  *Note Input and Output::.

 -- Built-in Function:  keyboard ()
 -- Built-in Function:  keyboard (PROMPT)
     This function is normally used for simple debugging.  When the `keyboard' function is executed, Octave prints a prompt and waits for user input.  The input strings are then evaluated and the results are printed.  This makes it possible to examine the values of variables within a function, and to assign new values if necessary.  To leave the prompt and return to normal execution type `return' or `dbcont'.  The `keyboard' function does not return an exit status.

     If `keyboard' is invoked without arguments, a default prompt of `debug> ' is used.

     Query or set the primary prompt string.  When executing interactively, Octave displays the primary prompt when it is ready to read a command.

     The default value of the primary prompt string is `"\s:\#> "'.  To change it, use a command like

          PS1 ("\\u@\\H> ")

     which will result in the prompt `boris@kremvax> ' for the user `boris' logged in on the host `kremvax.kgb.su'.  Note that two backslashes are required to enter a backslash into a double-quoted character string.  *Note Strings::.

     You can also use ANSI escape sequences if your terminal supports them.  This can be useful for coloring the prompt.  For example,

          PS1 ("\\[\\033[01;31m\\]\\s:\\#> \\[\\033[0m\]")

     will give the default Octave prompt a red coloring.

     returns the help string associated with the sub-function `mysubfunc' of the function `myfunc'.  Another use of `filemarker' is when debugging it allows easier placement of breakpoints within sub-functions.  For example,

          dbstop (["myfunc", filemarker, "mysubfunc"])

     will set a breakpoint at the first line of the subfunction `mysubfunc'.

 -- Command:  load file options
 -- Command:  load file options v1 v2 ...
 -- Command: S = load ("file", "options", "v1", "v2", ...)
     Load the named variables V1, V2, ..., from the file FILE.  If no variables are specified then all variables found in the file will be loaded.  As with `save', the list of variables to extract can be full names or use a pattern syntax.  The format of the file is automatically detected but may be overridden by supplying the appropriate option.

     If load is invoked using the functional form

          load ("-option1", ..., "file", "v1", ...)

     then the OPTIONS, FILE, and variable name arguments (V1, ...) must be specified as character strings.

     If a variable that is not marked as global is loaded from a file when a global symbol with the same name already exists, it is loaded in the global symbol table.  Also, if a variable is marked as global in a file and a local symbol exists, the local symbol is moved to the global symbol table and given the value from the file.

     If invoked with a single output argument, Octave returns data instead of inserting variables in the symbol table.  If the data file contains only numbers (TAB- or space-delimited columns), a matrix of values is returned.  Otherwise, `load' returns a structure with members  corresponding to the names of the variables in the file.

     The `load' command can read data stored in Octave's text and binary formats, and MATLAB's binary format.  If compiled with zlib support, it can also load gzip-compressed files.  It will automatically detect the type of file and do conversion from different floating point formats (currently only IEEE big and little endian, though other formats may be added in the future).

     Valid options for `load' are listed in the following table.

    `-force'
          This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.  Octave now overwrites variables currently in memory with those of the same name found in the file.

    `-ascii'
          Force Octave to assume the file contains columns of numbers in text format without any header or other information.  Data in the file will be loaded as a single numeric matrix with the name of the variable derived from the name of the file.

    `-binary'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's binary format.

    `-hdf5'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)  Note that Octave can read HDF5 files not created by itself, but may skip some datasets in formats that it cannot support.  This format is only available if Octave was built with a link to the HDF5 libraries.

    `-import'
          This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.  Octave can now support multi-dimensional HDF data and automatically modifies variable names if they are invalid Octave identifiers.

    `-mat'
    `-mat-binary'
    `-6'
    `-v6'
    `-7'
    `-v7'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in MATLAB's version 6 or 7 binary format.

    `-mat4-binary'
    `-4'
    `-v4'
    `-V4'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in the binary format written by MATLAB version 4.

    `-text'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's text format.

 -- Command:  save file
 -- Command:  save options file
 -- Command:  save options file V1 V2 ...
 -- Command:  save options file -struct STRUCT F1 F2 ...
     Save the named variables V1, V2, ..., in the file FILE.  The special filename `-' may be used to write output to the terminal.  If no variable names are listed, Octave saves all the variables in the current scope.  Otherwise, full variable names or pattern syntax can be used to specify the variables to save.  If the `-struct' modifier is used, fields F1 F2 ...  of the scalar structure STRUCT are saved as if they were variables with corresponding names.  Valid options for the `save' command are listed in the following table.  Options that modify the output format override the format specified by `default_save_options'.

     If save is invoked using the functional form

          save ("-option1", ..., "file", "v1", ...)

     then the OPTIONS, FILE, and variable name arguments (V1, ...) must be specified as character strings.

    `-append'
          Append to the destination instead of overwriting.

    `-ascii'
          Save a single matrix in a text file without header or any other information.

    `-binary'
          Save the data in Octave's binary data format.

    `-float-binary'
          Save the data in Octave's binary data format but only using single precision.  Only use this format if you know that all the values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

    `-hdf5'
          Save the data in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)  This format is only available if Octave was built with a link to the HDF5 libraries.

    `-float-hdf5'
          Save the data in HDF5 format but only using single precision.  Only use this format if you know that all the values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

    `-6'
    `-mat'
    `-mat-binary'
          Save the data in MATLAB's v6 binary data format.

    `-V4'
    `-v4'
    `-4'
    `-mat4-binary'
          Save the data in the binary format written by MATLAB version 4.

    `-text'
          Save the data in Octave's text data format.  (default).

    `-zip'
    `-z'
          Use the gzip algorithm to compress the file.  This works equally on files that are compressed with gzip outside of octave, and gzip can equally be used to convert the files for backward compatibility.  This option is only available if Octave was built with a link to the zlib libraries.

     The list of variables to save may use wildcard patterns containing the following special characters:

    `?'
          Match any single character.

    `*'
          Match zero or more characters.

    `[ LIST ]'
          Match the list of characters specified by LIST.  If the first character is `!' or `^', match all characters except those specified by LIST.  For example, the pattern `[a-zA-Z]' will match all lower and uppercase alphabetic characters.

          Wildcards may also be used in the field name specifications when using the `-struct' modifier (but not in the struct name itself).


     Except when using the MATLAB binary data file format or the `-ascii' format, saving global variables also saves the global status of the variable.  If the variable is restored at a later time using `load', it will be restored as a global variable.

     The command

          save -binary data a b*

     saves the variable `a' and all variables beginning with `b' to the file `data' in Octave's binary format.

 -- Command:  edit_history [FIRST] [LAST]
     If invoked with no arguments, `edit_history' allows you to edit the history list using the editor named by the variable `EDITOR'.  The commands to be edited are first copied to a temporary file.  When you exit the editor, Octave executes the commands that remain in the file.  It is often more convenient to use `edit_history' to define functions rather than attempting to enter them directly on the command line.  By default, the block of commands is executed as soon as you exit the editor.  To avoid executing any commands, simply delete all the lines from the buffer before exiting the editor.

     The `edit_history' command takes two optional arguments specifying the history numbers of first and last commands to edit.  For example, the command

          edit_history 13

     extracts all the commands from the 13th through the last in the history list.  The command

          edit_history 13 169

     only extracts commands 13 through 169.  Specifying a larger number for the first command than the last command reverses the list of commands before placing them in the buffer to be edited.  If both arguments are omitted, the previous command in the history list is used.

 -- Command:  history options
     If invoked with no arguments, `history' displays a list of commands that you have executed.  Valid options are:

    `-w FILE'
          Write the current history to the file FILE.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file (normally `~/.octave_hist').

    `-r FILE'
          Read the file FILE, appending its contents to the current history list.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file (normally `~/.octave_hist').

    `N'
          Display only the most recent N lines of history.

    `-q'
          Don't number the displayed lines of history.  This is useful for cutting and pasting commands using the X Window System.

     For example, to display the five most recent commands that you have typed without displaying line numbers, use the command `history -q 5'.

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = history_control ()

     Query or set the internal variable that specifies how commands are saved to the history list.  The default value is an empty character string, but may be overridden by the environment variable `OCTAVE_HISTCONTROL'.

     The value of `history_control' is a colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list.  If the list of values includes `ignorespace', lines which begin with a space character are not saved in the history list.  A value of `ignoredups' causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved.  A value of `ignoreboth' is shorthand for `ignorespace' and `ignoredups'.  A value of `erasedups' causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If `history_control' is the empty string, all commands are saved on the history list, subject to the value of `saving_history'.

 -- Built-in Function:  autoload (FUNCTION, FILE)
     Define FUNCTION to autoload from FILE.

     The second argument, FILE, should be an absolute file name or a file name in the same directory as the function or script from which the autoload command was run.  FILE should not depend on the Octave load path.

     Normally, calls to `autoload' appear in PKG_ADD script files that are evaluated when a directory is added to the Octave's load path.  To avoid having to hardcode directory names in FILE, if FILE is in the same directory as the PKG_ADD script then

          autoload ("foo", "bar.oct");

     will load the function `foo' from the file `bar.oct'.  The above when `bar.oct' is not in the same directory or uses like

          autoload ("foo", file_in_loadpath ("bar.oct"))

     are strongly discouraged, as their behavior might be unpredictable.

     With no arguments, return a structure containing the current autoload map.

 -- Built-in Function:  feval (NAME, ...)
     Evaluate the function named NAME.  Any arguments after the first are passed on to the named function.  For example,

          feval ("acos", -1)
               => 3.1416

     calls the function `acos' with the argument `-1'.

     The function `feval' can also be used with function handles of any sort (*note Function Handles::).  Historically, `feval' was the only way to call user-supplied functions in strings, but function handles are now preferred due to the cleaner syntax they offer.  For example,

          F = @exp;
          feval (F, 1)
              => 2.7183
          F (1)
              => 2.7183

     are equivalent ways to call the function referred to by F.  If it cannot be predicted beforehand that F is a function handle or the function name in a string, `feval' can be used instead.

eval


# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string
# elements: 1
# length: 953
 -- Built-in Function:  eval (TRY)
 -- Built-in Function:  eval (TRY, CATCH)
     Parse the string TRY and evaluate it as if it were an Octave program.  If that fails, evaluate the optional string CATCH.  The string TRY is evaluated in the current context, so any results remain available after `eval' returns.

     The following example makes the variable A with the approximate value 3.1416 available.

          eval ("a = acos(-1);");

     If an error occurs during the evaluation of TRY the CATCH string is evaluated, as the following example shows:

          eval ('error ("This is a bad example");',
                'printf ("This error occurred:\n%s\n", lasterr ());');
               -| This error occurred:
                  This is a bad example

     Consider using try/catch blocks instead if you are only using `eval' as an error-capturing mechanism rather than for the execution of arbitrary code strings.

 -- Command:  format
 -- Command:  format options
     Reset or specify the format of the output produced by `disp' and Octave's normal echoing mechanism.  This command only affects the display of numbers but not how they are stored or computed.  To change the internal representation from the default double use one of the conversion functions such as `single', `uint8', `int64', etc.

     By default, Octave displays 5 significant digits in a human readable form (option `short' paired with `loose' format for matrices).  If `format' is invoked without any options, this default format is restored.

     Valid formats for floating point numbers are listed in the following table.

    `short'
          Fixed point format with 5 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 10 characters wide.  (default).

          If Octave is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the decimal point and all numbers fit within the maximum field width then it switches to an exponential `e' format.

    `long'
          Fixed point format with 15 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 20 characters wide.

          As with the `short' format, Octave will switch to an exponential `e' format if it is unable to format a matrix properly using the current format.

    `short e'
    `long e'
          Exponential format.  The number to be represented is split between a mantissa and an exponent (power of 10).  The mantissa has 5 significant digits in the short format and 15 digits in the long format.  For example, with the `short e' format, `pi' is displayed as `3.1416e+00'.

    `short E'
    `long E'
          Identical to `short e' or `long e' but displays an uppercase `E' to indicate the exponent.  For example, with the `long E' format, `pi' is displayed as `3.14159265358979E+00'.

    `short g'
    `long g'
          Optimally choose between fixed point and exponential format based on the magnitude of the number.  For example, with the `short g' format, `pi .^ [2; 4; 8; 16; 32]' is displayed as

               ans =

                     9.8696
                     97.409
                     9488.5
                 9.0032e+07
                 8.1058e+15

    `short eng'
    `long eng'
          Identical to `short e' or `long e' but displays the value using an engineering format, where the exponent is divisible by 3. For example, with the `short eng' format, `10 * pi' is displayed as `31.4159e+00'.

    `long G'
    `short G'
          Identical to `short g' or `long g' but displays an uppercase `E' to indicate the exponent.

    `free'
    `none'
          Print output in free format, without trying to line up columns of matrices on the decimal point.  This also causes complex numbers to be formatted as numeric pairs like this `(0.60419, 0.60709)' instead of like this `0.60419 + 0.60709i'.

     The following formats affect all numeric output (floating point and integer types).

    `+'
    `+ CHARS'
    `plus'
    `plus CHARS'
          Print a `+' symbol for nonzero matrix elements and a space for zero matrix elements.  This format can be very useful for examining the structure of a large sparse matrix.

          The optional argument CHARS specifies a list of 3 characters to use for printing values greater than zero, less than zero and equal to zero.  For example, with the `+ "+-."' format, `[1, 0, -1; -1, 0, 1]' is displayed as

               ans =

               +.-
               -.+

    `bank'
          Print in a fixed format with two digits to the right of the decimal point.

    `native-hex'
          Print the hexadecimal representation of numbers as they are stored in memory.  For example, on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first, the value of `pi' when printed in `native-hex' format is `400921fb54442d18'.

    `hex'
          The same as `native-hex', but always print the most significant byte first.

    `native-bit'
          Print the bit representation of numbers as stored in memory.  For example, the value of `pi' is

               01000000000010010010000111111011
               01010100010001000010110100011000

          (shown here in two 32 bit sections for typesetting purposes) when printed in native-bit format on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first.

    `bit'
          The same as `native-bit', but always print the most significant bits first.

    `rat'
          Print a rational approximation, i.e., values are approximated as the ratio of small integers.  For example, with the `rat' format, `pi' is displayed as `355/113'.

     The following two options affect the display of all matrices.

    `compact'
          Remove blank lines around column number labels and between matrices producing more compact output with more data per page.

    `loose'
          Insert blank lines above and below column number labels and between matrices to produce a more readable output with less data per page.  (default).

 -- Loadable Function: S = sparse (I, J, SV)
 -- Loadable Function: S = sparse (I, J, S, M, N, "unique")
 -- Loadable Function: S = sparse (M, N)
     Create a sparse matrix from the full matrix or row, column, value triplets.  If A is a full matrix, convert it to a sparse matrix representation, removing all zero values in the process.

     Given the integer index vectors I and J, a 1-by-`nnz' vector of real of complex values SV, overall dimensions M and N of the sparse matrix.  The argument `nzmax' is ignored but accepted for compatibility with MATLAB.  If M or N are not specified their values are derived from the maximum index in the vectors I and J as given by `M = max (I)', `N = max (J)'.

     *Note*: if multiple values are specified with the same I, J indices, the corresponding values in S will be added.  See `accumarray' for an example of how to produce different behavior, such as taking the minimum instead.

     The following are all equivalent:

          s = sparse (i, j, s, m, n)
          s = sparse (i, j, s, m, n, "summation")
          s = sparse (i, j, s, m, n, "sum")

     Given the option "unique". if more than two values are specified for the same I, J indices, the last specified value will be used.

     `sparse(M, N)' is equivalent to `sparse ([], [], [], M, N, 0)'

     If any of SV, I or J are scalars, they are expanded to have a common size.

 -- Loadable Function: S = spalloc (M, N, NZ)
     Create an M-by-N sparse matrix with pre-allocated space for at most NZ nonzero elements.  This is useful for building the matrix incrementally by a sequence of indexed assignments.  Subsequent indexed assignments will reuse the pre-allocated memory, provided they are of one of the simple forms

        * `S(I:J) = X'

        * `S(:,I:J) = X'

        * `S(K:L,I:J) = X'

     and that the following conditions are met:

        * the assignment does not decrease nnz(S).

        * after the assignment, nnz(S) does not exceed NZ.

        * no index is out of bounds.

     Partial movement of data may still occur, but in general the assignment will be more memory and time-efficient under these circumstances.  In particular, it is possible to efficiently build a pre-allocated sparse matrix from contiguous block of columns.

     The amount of pre-allocated memory for a given matrix may be queried using the function `nzmax'.

     Create a string array from one or more numeric matrices, character matrices, or cell arrays.  Arguments are concatenated vertically.  The returned values are padded with blanks as needed to make each row of the string array have the same length.  Empty input strings are significant and will concatenated in the output.

     For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  A range error results if an input is outside the ASCII range (0-255).

     For cell arrays, each element is concatenated separately.  Cell arrays converted through `char' can mostly be converted back with `cellstr'.  For example:

          char ([97, 98, 99], "", {"98", "99", 100}, "str1", ["ha", "lf"])
             => ["abc    "

 -- Built-in Function:  strvcat (S1, S2, ...)
 -- Built-in Function:  strvcat (CELL_ARRAY)
     Create a character array from one or more numeric matrices, character matrices, or cell arrays.  Arguments are concatenated vertically.  The returned values are padded with blanks as needed to make each row of the string array have the same length.  Unlike `char', empty strings are removed and will not appear in the output.

     For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  A range error results if an input is outside the ASCII range (0-255).

     For cell arrays, each element is concatenated separately.  Cell arrays converted through `strvcat' can mostly be converted back with `cellstr'.  For example:

          strvcat ([97, 98, 99], "", {"98", "99", 100}, "str1", ["ha", "lf"])
                => ["abc    "

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave checks the time stamp on files each time it looks up functions defined in function files.  If the internal variable is set to `"system"', Octave will not automatically recompile function files in subdirectories of `OCTAVE-HOME/lib/VERSION' if they have changed since they were last compiled, but will recompile other function files in the search path if they change.  If set to `"all"', Octave will not recompile any function files unless their definitions are removed with `clear'.  If set to "none", Octave will always check time stamps on files to determine whether functions defined in function files need to recompiled.

     Replace current process with a new process.  Calling `exec' without first calling `fork' will terminate your current Octave process and replace it with the program named by FILE.  For example,

          exec ("ls" "-l")

     will run `ls' and return you to your shell prompt.

     If successful, `exec' does not return.  If `exec' does return, ERR will be nonzero, and MSG will contain a system-dependent error message.

popen2


# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string
# elements: 1

 -- Built-in Function: [IN, OUT, PID] = popen2 (COMMAND, ARGS)
     Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  The name of the process is given by COMMAND, and ARGS is an array of strings containing options for the command.  The file identifiers for the input and output streams of the subprocess are returned in IN and OUT.  If execution of the command is successful, PID contains the process ID of the subprocess.  Otherwise, PID is -1.

     For example:

          [in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-r");
          fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
          fclose (in);
          EAGAIN = errno ("EAGAIN");
          done = false;
          do
            s = fgets (out);
            if (ischar (s))
              fputs (stdout, s);
            elseif (errno () == EAGAIN)
              sleep (0.1);
              fclear (out);
            else
              done = true;
            endif
          until (done)
          fclose (out);

             -| strings
             -| some
             -| are

     Note that `popen2', unlike `popen', will not "reap" the child process.  If you don't use `waitpid' to check the child's exit status, it will linger until Octave exits.

     Fork can return one of the following values:

    > 0
          You are in the parent process.  The value returned from `fork' is the process id of the child process.  You should probably arrange to wait for any child processes to exit.

    0
          You are in the child process.  You can call `exec' to start another process.  If that fails, you should probably call `exit'.

    < 0
          The call to `fork' failed for some reason.  You must take evasive action.  A system dependent error message will be waiting in MSG.

waitpid

 -- Built-in Function: [PID, STATUS, MSG] = waitpid (PID, OPTIONS)
     Wait for process PID to terminate.  The PID argument can be:

    -1
          Wait for any child process.

    0
          Wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of the Octave interpreter process.

    > 0
          Wait for termination of the child process with ID PID.

     The OPTIONS argument can be a bitwise OR of zero or more of the following constants:

    `0'
          Wait until signal is received or a child process exits (this is the default if the OPTIONS argument is missing).

    `WNOHANG'
          Do not hang if status is not immediately available.

    `WUNTRACED'
          Report the status of any child processes that are stopped, and whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped.

    `WCONTINUE'
          Return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of `SIGCONT'.  This value may not be meaningful on all systems.

     If the returned value of PID is greater than 0, it is the process ID of the child process that exited.  If an error occurs, PID will be less than zero and MSG will contain a system-dependent error message.  The value of STATUS contains additional system-dependent information about the subprocess that exited.

If the tilde is followed immediately by a slash, the tilde is replaced by the home directory of the user running Octave.  For example:

          tilde_expand ("~joeuser/bin")

 -- Built-in Function:  system ("STRING")
 -- Built-in Function:  system ("STRING", RETURN_OUTPUT)
 -- Built-in Function:  system ("STRING", RETURN_OUTPUT, TYPE)
 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, OUTPUT] = system (...)
     Execute a shell command specified by STRING.  If the optional argument TYPE is "async", the process is started in the background and the process ID of the child process is returned immediately.  Otherwise, the child process is started and Octave waits until it exits.  If the TYPE argument is omitted, it defaults to the value "sync".

     If SYSTEM is called with one or more output arguments, or if the optional argument RETURN_OUTPUT is true and the subprocess is started synchronously, then the output from the command is returned as a variable.  Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously, its output is sent to the standard output.  To send the output of a command executed with `system' through the pager, use a command like

          [output, text] = system ("cmd");
          disp (text);

     or

          printf ("%s\n", nthargout (2, "system", "cmd"));

     The `system' function can return two values.  The first is the exit status of the command and the second is any output from the command that was written to the standard output stream.  For example,

          [status, output] = system ("echo foo; exit 2");

     will set the variable `output' to the string `foo', and the variable `status' to the integer `2'.

     For commands run asynchronously, STATUS is the process id of the command shell that is started to run the command.

 -- Built-in Function:  atexit (FCN, FLAG)
     Register a function to be called when Octave exits.  For example,

            disp ("Bye bye");
          endfunction
          atexit ("last_words");

     will print the message "Bye bye" when Octave exits.

     The additional argument FLAG will register or unregister FCN from the list of functions to be called when Octave exits.  If FLAG is true, the function is registered, and if FLAG is false, it is unregistered.  For example, after registering the function `last_words' above,

          atexit ("last_words", false);

     will remove the function from the list and Octave will not call `last_words' when it exits.

     Note that `atexit' only removes the first occurrence of a function from the list, so if a function was placed in the list multiple times with `atexit', it must also be removed from the list multiple times.

     assigns the value of the alert character (control-g, ASCII code 7) to the string variable `bell'.  If this string is printed, the system will ring the terminal bell (if it is possible).  This is normally the desired outcome.  However, sometimes it is useful to be able to print the original representation of the string, with the special characters replaced by their escape sequences.  For example,

          octave:13> undo_string_escapes (bell)
          ans = \a

     replaces the unprintable alert character with its printable representation.

     List currently defined variables matching the given patterns.  Valid pattern syntax is the same as described for the `clear' command.  If no patterns are supplied, all variables are listed.  By default, only variables visible in the local scope are displayed.

     The following are valid options but may not be combined.

    `global'
          List variables in the global scope rather than the current scope.

    `-regexp'
          The patterns are considered to be regular expressions when matching the variables to display.  The same pattern syntax accepted by the `regexp' function is used.

    `-file'
          The next argument is treated as a filename.  All variables found within the specified file are listed.  No patterns are accepted when reading variables from a file.

     If called as a function, return a cell array of defined variable names matching the given patterns.

     Provide detailed information on currently defined variables matching the given patterns.  Options and pattern syntax are the same as for the `who' command.  Extended information about each variable is summarized in a table with the following default entries.

    Attr
          Attributes of the listed variable.  Possible attributes are:

         blank
               Variable in local scope

         `a'
               Automatic variable.  An automatic variable is one created by the interpreter, for example `argn'.

         `c'
               Variable of complex type.

         `f'
               Formal parameter (function argument).

         `g'
               Variable with global scope.

         `p'
               Persistent variable.

    Name
          The name of the variable.

    Size
          The logical size of the variable.  A scalar is 1x1, a vector is 1xN or Nx1, a 2-D matrix is MxN.

    Bytes
          The amount of memory currently used to store the variable.

    Class
          The class of the variable.  Examples include double, single, char, uint16, cell, and struct.

     The table can be customized to display more or less information through the function `whos_line_format'.

     If `whos' is called as a function, return a struct array of defined variable names matching the given patterns.  Fields in the structure describing each variable are: name, size, bytes, class, global, sparse, complex, nesting, persistent.

 -- Command:  clear [options] pattern ...
     Delete the names matching the given patterns from the symbol table.  The pattern may contain the following special characters:

    `?'
          Match any single character.

    `*'
          Match zero or more characters.

    `[ LIST ]'
          Match the list of characters specified by LIST.  If the first character is `!' or `^', match all characters except those specified by LIST.  For example, the pattern `[a-zA-Z]' will match all lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters.

     For example, the command

          clear foo b*r

     clears the name `foo' and all names that begin with the letter `b' and end with the letter `r'.

     If `clear' is called without any arguments, all user-defined variables (local and global) are cleared from the symbol table.  If `clear' is called with at least one argument, only the visible names matching the arguments are cleared.  For example, suppose you have defined a function `foo', and then hidden it by performing the assignment `foo = 2'.  Executing the command `clear foo' once will clear the variable definition and restore the definition of `foo' as a function.  Executing `clear foo' a second time will clear the function definition.

     The following options are available in both long and short form

    `-all, -a'
          Clears all local and global user-defined variables and all functions from the symbol table.

    `-exclusive, -x'
          Clears the variables that don't match the following pattern.

    `-functions, -f'
          Clears the function names and the built-in symbols names.

    `-global, -g'
          Clears the global symbol names.

    `-variables, -v'
          Clears the local variable names.

    `-classes, -c'
          Clears the class structure table and clears all objects.

    `-regexp, -r'
          The arguments are treated as regular expressions as any variables that match will be cleared.
     With the exception of `exclusive', all long options can be used without the dash as well.

 -- Built-in Function:  whos_line_format (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the format string used by the command `whos'.

     A full format string is:

          %[modifier]<command>[:width[:left-min[:balance]]];

     The following command sequences are available:

    `%a'
          Prints attributes of variables (g=global, p=persistent, f=formal parameter, a=automatic variable).

    `%b'
          Prints number of bytes occupied by variables.

    `%c'
          Prints class names of variables.

    `%e'
          Prints elements held by variables.

    `%n'
          Prints variable names.

    `%s'
          Prints dimensions of variables.

    `%t'
          Prints type names of variables.

     Every command may also have an alignment modifier:

    `l'
          Left alignment.

    `r'
          Right alignment (default).

    `c'
          Column-aligned (only applicable to command %s).

     The `width' parameter is a positive integer specifying the minimum number of columns used for printing.  No maximum is needed as the field will auto-expand as required.

     The parameters `left-min' and `balance' are only available when the column-aligned modifier is used with the command `%s'.  `balance' specifies the column number within the field width which will be aligned between entries.  Numbering starts from 0 which indicates the leftmost column.  `left-min' specifies the minimum field width to the left of the specified balance column.

     The default format is `"  %a:4; %ln:6; %cs:16:6:1;  %rb:12;  %lc:-1;\n"'.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

The generated function arguments will then be in alphabetical order.  It should be noted that i, and j are ignored as arguments due to the ambiguity between their use as a variable or their use as an inbuilt constant.  All arguments followed by a parenthesis are considered to be functions.

     If the second and subsequent arguments are character strings, they are the names of the arguments of the function.

     If the second argument is an integer N, the arguments are `"x"', `"P1"', ..., `"PN"'.

 -- Built-in Function:  vectorize (FUN)
     Create a vectorized version of the inline function FUN by replacing all occurrences of `*', `/', etc., with `.*', `./', etc.

     This may be useful, for example, when using inline functions with numerical integration or optimization where a vector-valued function is expected.

          fcn = vectorize (inline ("x^2 - 1"))
             => fcn = f(x) = x.^2 - 1
          quadv (fcn, 0, 3)
             => 6

 -- Built-in Function:  isnull (X)
     Return true if X is a special null matrix, string, or single quoted string.  Indexed assignment with such a value on the right-hand side should delete array elements.  This function should be used when overloading indexed assignment for user-defined classes instead of `isempty', to distinguish the cases:

    `A(I) = []'
          This should delete elements if `I' is nonempty.

    `X = []; A(I) = X'
          This should give an error if `I' is nonempty.

     *See also:* isempty, isindex.

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether non-integer ranges are allowed as indices.  This might be useful for MATLAB compatibility; however, it is still not entirely compatible because MATLAB treats the range expression differently in different contexts.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

 -- Built-in Function:  nargout ()

     Within a function, return the number of values the caller expects to receive.  If called with the optional argument FCN, a function name or handle, return the number of declared output values that the function can produce.  If the final output argument is VARARGOUT the returned value is negative.

     For example,

          f ()

     will cause `nargout' to return 0 inside the function `f' and

          [s, t] = f ()

     will cause `nargout' to return 2 inside the function `f'.

     In the second usage,

          nargout (@histc) % or nargout ('histc')

     will return 2, because `histc' has two outputs, whereas

          nargout (@deal)

     will return -1, because `deal' has a variable number of outputs.

     At the top level, `nargout' with no argument is undefined.  `nargout' does not work on builtin functions.  `nargout' returns -1 for all anonymous functions.

 -- Built-in Function:  isargout (K)
     Within a function, return a logical value indicating whether the argument K will be assigned on output to a variable.  If the result is false, the argument has been ignored during the function call through the use of the tilde (~) special output argument.  Functions can use `isargout' to avoid performing unnecessary calculations for outputs which are unwanted.

     If K is outside the range `1:max(nargout)', the function returns false.  K can also be an array, in which case the function works element-by-element and a logical array is returned.  At the top level, `isargout' returns an error.

 -- Built-in Function:  subsref (VAL, IDX)
     Perform the subscripted element selection operation according to the subscript specified by IDX.

     The subscript IDX is expected to be a structure array with fields `type' and `subs'.  Valid values for `type' are `"()"', `"{}"', and `"."'.  The `subs' field may be either `":"' or a cell array of index values.

     The following example shows how to set the two first columns of a 3-by-3 matrix to zero.

          val = magic (3);
          idx.type = "()";

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave will do short-circuit evaluation of `|' and `&' operators inside the conditions of if or while statements.

     This feature is only provided for compatibility with MATLAB and should not be used unless you are porting old code that relies on this feature.

     To obtain short-circuit behavior for logical expressions in new programs, you should always use the `&&' and `||' operators.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

     Return the approximate minimum degree permutation of a matrix.  This permutation such that the Cholesky factorization of `S (P, P)' tends to be sparser than the Cholesky factorization of S itself.  `amd' is typically faster than `symamd' but serves a similar purpose.

     The optional parameter OPTS is a structure that controls the behavior of `amd'.  The fields of the structure are

    OPTS.dense
          Determines what `amd' considers to be a dense row or column of the input matrix.  Rows or columns with more than `max(16, (dense * sqrt (N)' entries, where N is the order of the matrix S, are ignored by `amd' during the calculation of the permutation The value of dense must be a positive scalar and its default value is 10.0

    OPTS.aggressive
          If this value is a non zero scalar, then `amd' performs aggressive absorption.  The default is not to perform aggressive absorption.

     The author of the code itself is Timothy A. Davis <davis@cise.ufl.edu>, University of Florida (see `http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/amd').

 -- Loadable Function: [DD, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [D, P, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [CC, DD, AA, BB] = balance (A, B, OPT)
     Compute `AA = DD \ A * DD' in which AA is a matrix whose row and column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and `DD = P * D', in which P is a permutation matrix and D is a diagonal matrix of powers of two.  This allows the equilibration to be computed without round-off.  Results of eigenvalue calculation are typically improved by balancing first.

     If two output values are requested, `balance' returns the diagonal D and the permutation P separately as vectors.  In this case, `DD = eye(n)(:,P) * diag (D)', where n is the matrix size.

     If four output values are requested, compute `AA = CC*A*DD' and `BB = CC*B*DD', in which AA and BB have non-zero elements of approximately the same magnitude and CC and DD are permuted diagonal matrices as in DD for the algebraic eigenvalue problem.

     The eigenvalue balancing option OPT may be one of:

    "noperm", "S"
          Scale only; do not permute.

    "noscal", "P"
          Permute only; do not scale.

     Algebraic eigenvalue balancing uses standard LAPACK routines.

     Generalized eigenvalue problem balancing uses Ward's algorithm (SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 1981).

     Constrained column approximate minimum degree permutation.  `P = ccolamd (S)' returns the column approximate minimum degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric matrix S, `S(:, P)' tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  `chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))' also tends to be sparser than `chol (S' * S)'.  `P = ccolamd (S, 1)' optimizes the ordering for `lu (S(:, P))'.  The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     KNOBS is an optional 1-element to 5-element input vector, with a default value of `[0 10 10 1 0]' if not present or empty.  Entries not present are set to their defaults.

    `KNOBS(1)'
          if nonzero, the ordering is optimized for `lu (S(:, p))'.  It will be a poor ordering for `chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))'.  This is the most important knob for ccolamd.

    `KNOBS(2)'
          if S is m-by-n, rows with more than `max (16, KNOBS(2) * sqrt (n))' entries are ignored.

    `KNOBS(3)'
          columns with more than `max (16, KNOBS(3) * sqrt (min (M, N)))' entries are ignored and ordered last in the output permutation (subject to the cmember constraints).

    `KNOBS(4)'
          if nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

    `KNOBS(5)'
          if nonzero, statistics and knobs are printed.


     CMEMBER is an optional vector of length n.  It defines the constraints on the column ordering.  If `CMEMBER(j) = C', then column J is in constraint set C (C must be in the range 1 to n).  In the output permutation P, all columns in set 1 appear first, followed by all columns in set 2, and so on.  `CMEMBER = ones(1,n)' if not present or empty.  `ccolamd (S, [], 1 : n)' returns `1 : n'

     `P = ccolamd (S)' is about the same as `P = colamd (S)'.  KNOBS and its default values differ.  `colamd' always does aggressive absorption, and it finds an ordering suitable for both `lu (S(:, P))' and `chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))'; it cannot optimize its ordering for `lu (S(:, P))' to the extent that `ccolamd (S, 1)' can.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in `STATS(1 : 3)'.  `STATS(1)' and `STATS(2)' are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by CCOLAMD and `STATS(3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by CCOLAMD (roughly of size `2.2 * nnz (S) + 4 * M + 7 * N' integers).

     `STATS(4 : 7)' provide information if CCOLAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if `STATS(4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  `STATS(5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  `STATS(6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by `STATS(5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  `STATS(7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  `STATS(8 : 20)' is always zero in the current version of CCOLAMD (reserved for future use).

The ordering is followed by an elimination tree post-ordering.

In the case of a character string argument, the function must accept a single argument named X, and it must return a string value.  The function can take one or more arguments, with the inputs arguments given by C, D, etc.  Equally the function can return one or more output arguments.  For example:

          cellfun ("atan2", {1, 0}, {0, 1})
               => [ 1.57080   0.00000 ]

     The number of output arguments of `cellfun' matches the number of output arguments of the function.  The outputs of the function will be collected into the output arguments of `cellfun' like this:

          function [a, b] = twoouts (x)
            a = x;
            b = x*x;
          endfunction
          [aa, bb] = cellfun(@twoouts, {1, 2, 3})
               =>
                  aa =
                     1 2 3
                  bb =
                     1 4 9

     Note that per default the output argument(s) are arrays of the same size as the input arguments.  Input arguments that are singleton (1x1) cells will be automatically expanded to the size of the other arguments.

     If the parameter "UniformOutput" is set to true (the default), then the function must return scalars which will be concatenated into the return array(s).  If "UniformOutput" is false, the outputs are concatenated into a cell array (or cell arrays).  For example:

          cellfun ("tolower", {"Foo", "Bar", "FooBar"},
                   "UniformOutput", false)
          => {"foo", "bar", "foobar"}

     Given the parameter "ErrorHandler", then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in case FUNC generates an error.  The form of the function is

          function [...] = errfunc (S, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by S.  This is a structure with the elements 'identifier', 'message' and 'index', giving respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the input arguments of the element that caused the error.  For example:

          function y = foo (s, x), y = NaN; endfunction
          cellfun ("factorial", {-1,2}, "ErrorHandler", @foo)
          => [NaN 2]

     Use `cellfun' intelligently.  The `cellfun' function is a useful tool for avoiding loops.  It is often used with anonymous function handles; however, calling an anonymous function involves an overhead quite comparable to the overhead of an m-file function.  Passing a handle to a built-in function is faster, because the interpreter is not involved in the internal loop.  For example:

          a = {...}
          v = cellfun (@(x) det(x), a); # compute determinants
          v = cellfun (@det, a); # faster

 -- Function File: [X, Y, ...] = arrayfun (FUNC, A, ...)
 -- Function File:  arrayfun (..., "UniformOutput", VAL)
 -- Function File:  arrayfun (..., "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC)
     Execute a function on each element of an array.  This is useful for functions that do not accept array arguments.  If the function does accept array arguments it is better to call the function directly.

     The first input argument FUNC can be a string, a function handle, an inline function, or an anonymous function.  The input argument A can be a logic array, a numeric array, a string array, a structure array, or a cell array.  By a call of the function `arrayfun' all elements of A are passed on to the named function FUNC individually.

     The named function can also take more than two input arguments, with the input arguments given as third input argument B, fourth input argument C, ...  If given more than one array input argument then all input arguments must have the same sizes, for example:

          arrayfun (@atan2, [1, 0], [0, 1])
               => [ 1.5708   0.0000 ]

     If the parameter VAL after a further string input argument "UniformOutput" is set `true' (the default), then the named function FUNC must return a single element which then will be concatenated into the return value and is of type matrix.  Otherwise, if that parameter is set to `false', then the outputs are concatenated in a cell array.  For example:

          arrayfun (@(x,y) x:y, "abc", "def", "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
             {
               [1,1] = abcd
               [1,2] = bcde
               [1,3] = cdef
             }

     If more than one output arguments are given then the named function must return the number of return values that also are expected, for example:

          [A, B, C] = arrayfun (@find, [10; 0], "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
          A =
          {
             [1,1] =  1
             [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }
          B =
          {
             [1,1] =  1
             [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }
          C =
          {
             [1,1] =  10
             [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }

     If the parameter ERRFUNC after a further string input argument "ErrorHandler" is another string, a function handle, an inline function, or an anonymous function, then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in the case that FUNC generates an error.  The definition of the function must be of the form

          function [...] = errfunc (S, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by S.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message", and "index" giving, respectively, the error identifier, the error message, and the index of the array elements that caused the error.  The size of the output argument of ERRFUNC must have the same size as the output argument of FUNC, otherwise a real error is thrown.  For example:

          function y = ferr (s, x), y = "MyString"; endfunction
          arrayfun (@str2num, [1234],
                    "UniformOutput", false, "ErrorHandler", @ferr)
          =>
             {
               [1,1] = MyString
             }

 -- Loadable Function: C = mat2cell (A, R)
     Convert the matrix A to a cell array.  If A is 2-D, then it is required that `sum (M) == size (A, 1)' and `sum (N) == size (A, 2)'.  Similarly, if A is multi-dimensional and the number of dimensional arguments is equal to the dimensions of A, then it is required that `sum (DI) == size (A, i)'.

     Given a single dimensional argument R, the other dimensional arguments are assumed to equal `size (A,I)'.

     Given an array X, this function produces a cell array of slices from the array determined by the index vectors LB, UB, for lower and upper bounds, respectively.  In other words, it is equivalent to the following code:

          n = length (lb);
          sl = cell (1, n);
          for i = 1:length (lb)
            sl{i} = x(:,...,lb(i):ub(i),...,:);
          endfor

     The position of the index is determined by DIM.  If not specified, slicing is done along the first non-singleton dimension.

 -- Loadable Function: [L, ...] = chol (..., "upper")
     Compute the Cholesky factor, R, of the symmetric positive definite matrix A, where

          R' * R = A.

     Called with one output argument `chol' fails if A or S is not positive definite.  With two or more output arguments P flags whether the matrix was positive definite and `chol' does not fail.  A zero value indicated that the matrix was positive definite and the R gives the factorization, and P will have a positive value otherwise.

     If called with 3 outputs then a sparsity preserving row/column permutation is applied to A prior to the factorization.  That is R is the factorization of `A(Q,Q)' such that

          R' * R = Q' * A * Q.

     The sparsity preserving permutation is generally returned as a matrix.  However, given the flag "vector", Q will be returned as a vector such that

          R' * R = A(Q, Q).

     Called with either a sparse or full matrix and using the "lower" flag, `chol' returns the lower triangular factorization such that

          L * L' = A.

     For full matrices, if the "lower" flag is set only the lower triangular part of the matrix is used for the factorization, otherwise the upper triangular part is used.

     In general the lower triangular factorization is significantly faster for sparse matrices.

     Column approximate minimum degree permutation.  `P = colamd (S)' returns the column approximate minimum degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric matrix S, `S(:,P)' tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  The Cholesky factorization of `S(:,P)' * S(:,P)' also tends to be sparser than that of `S' * S'.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to three-element input vector.  If S is m-by-n, then rows with more than `max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are ignored.  Columns with more than `max(16,KNOBS(2)*sqrt(min(m,n)))' entries are removed prior to ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  Only completely dense rows or columns are removed if `KNOBS(1)' and `KNOBS(2)' are < 0, respectively.  If `KNOBS(3)' is nonzero, STATS and KNOBS are printed.  The default is `KNOBS = [10 10 0]'.  Note that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of colamd.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in `STATS(1:3)'.  `STATS(1)' and `STATS(2)' are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by COLAMD and `STATS(3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by COLAMD (roughly of size `2.2 * nnz(S) + 4 * M + 7 * N' integers).

     Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse matrices, with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of the nonzeros in each column, with a non-negative number of entries in each column (!)  and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then COLAMD may or may not be able to continue.  If there are duplicate entries (a row index appears two or more times in the same column) or if the row indices in a column are out of order, then COLAMD can correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate entries and sorting each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the input matrix S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in other ways then COLAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and no output arguments (P or STATS) are returned.  COLAMD is thus a simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it's valid.

     `STATS(4:7)' provide information if COLAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if `STATS(4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  `STATS(5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  `STATS(6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by `STATS(5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  `STATS(7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  `STATS(8:20)' is always zero in the current version of COLAMD (reserved for future use).

     The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A.  Davis <davis@cise.ufl.edu>, University of Florida.  The algorithm was developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and Esmond Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  (see `http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/colamd')

Sometimes `symamd' works well for symmetric indefinite matrices too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to two-element input vector.  If S is n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than `max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are removed prior to ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  No rows/columns are removed if `KNOBS(1) < 0'.  If `KNOBS (2)' is nonzero, `stats' and KNOBS are printed.  The default is `KNOBS = [10 0]'.  Note that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of symamd.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in `STATS(1:3)'.  `STATS(1) = STATS(2)' is the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by SYMAMD and `STATS(3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by SYMAMD (roughly of size `8.4 * nnz (tril (S, -1)) + 9 * N' integers).

     Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse matrices, with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of the nonzeros in each column, with a non-negative number of entries in each column (!)  and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then SYMAMD may or may not be able to continue.  If there are duplicate entries (a row index appears two or more times in the same column) or if the row indices in a column are out of order, then SYMAMD can correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate entries and sorting each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the input matrix S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in other ways then SYMAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and no output arguments (P or STATS) are returned.  SYMAMD is thus a simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it's valid.

     `STATS(4:7)' provide information if SYMAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if `STATS (4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  `STATS(5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  `STATS(6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by `STATS(5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  `STATS(7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  `STATS(8:20)' is always zero in the current version of SYMAMD (reserved for future use).

     The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A.  Davis <davis@cise.ufl.edu>, University of Florida.  The algorithm was developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and Esmond Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  (see `http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/colamd')

     Compute the convex hull of the set of points PTS which is a matrix of size [n, dim] containing n points in a space of dimension dim.  The hull H is an index vector into the set of points and specifies which points form the enclosing hull.

     An optional second argument, which must be a string or cell array of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details `http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options'.  The default options depend on the dimension of the input:

        * 2D, 3D, 4D: OPTIONS = `{"Qt"}'

        * 5D and higher: OPTIONS = `{"Qt", "Qx"}'

     If OPTIONS is not present or `[]' then the default arguments are used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no arguments.

     If the second output V is requested the volume of the enclosing convex hull is calculated.

     Query or set options for the function `daspk'.  When called with no arguments, the names of all available options and their current values are displayed.  Given one argument, return the value of the corresponding option.  When called with two arguments, `daspk_options' set the option OPT to value VAL.

     Options include

    `"absolute tolerance"'
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

    `"relative tolerance"'
          Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i))
                      <= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)

    `"compute consistent initial condition"'
          Denoting the differential variables in the state vector by `Y_d' and the algebraic variables by `Y_a', `ddaspk' can solve one of two initialization problems:

            1. Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y'_d

            2. Given Y', calculate Y.

          In either case, initial values for the given components are input, and initial guesses for the unknown components must also be provided as input.  Set this option to 1 to solve the first problem, or 2 to solve the second (the default is 0, so you must provide a set of initial conditions that are consistent).

          If this option is set to a nonzero value, you must also set the `"algebraic variables"' option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic.

    `"use initial condition heuristics"'
          Set to a nonzero value to use the initial condition heuristics options described below.

    `"initial condition heuristics"'
          A vector of the following parameters that can be used to control the initial condition calculation.

         `MXNIT'
               Maximum number of Newton iterations (default is 5).

         `MXNJ'
               Maximum number of Jacobian evaluations (default is 6).

         `MXNH'
               Maximum number of values of the artificial stepsize parameter to be tried if the `"compute consistent initial condition"' option has been set to 1 (default is 5).

               Note that the maximum total number of Newton iterations allowed is `MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH' if the `"compute consistent initial condition"' option has been set to 1 and `MXNIT*MXNJ' if it is set to 2.

         `LSOFF'
               Set to a nonzero value to disable the linesearch algorithm (default is 0).

         `STPTOL'
               Minimum scaled step in linesearch algorithm (default is eps^(2/3)).

         `EPINIT'
               Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.  The test is applied to the residual vector, premultiplied by the approximate Jacobian.  For convergence, the weighted RMS norm of this vector (scaled by the error weights) must be less than `EPINIT*EPCON', where `EPCON' = 0.33 is the analogous test constant used in the time steps.  The default is `EPINIT' = 0.01.

    `"print initial condition info"'
          Set this option to a nonzero value to display detailed information about the initial condition calculation (default is 0).

    `"exclude algebraic variables from error test"'
          Set to a nonzero value to exclude algebraic variables from the error test.  You must also set the `"algebraic variables"' option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic (default is 0).

    `"algebraic variables"'
          A vector of the same length as the state vector.  A nonzero element indicates that the corresponding element of the state vector is an algebraic variable (i.e., its derivative does not appear explicitly in the equation set.

          This option is required by the `compute consistent initial condition"' and `"exclude algebraic variables from error test"' options.

    `"enforce inequality constraints"'
          Set to one of the following values to enforce the inequality constraints specified by the `"inequality constraint types"' option (default is 0).

            1. To have constraint checking only in the initial condition calculation.

            2. To enforce constraint checking during the integration.

            3. To enforce both options 1 and 2.

    `"inequality constraint types"'
          A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type of inequality constraint.  Each element of the vector corresponds to an element of the state and should be assigned one of the following codes

         -2
               Less than zero.

         -1
               Less than or equal to zero.

         0
               Not constrained.

         1
               Greater than or equal to zero.

         2
               Greater than zero.

          This option only has an effect if the `"enforce inequality constraints"' option is nonzero.

    `"initial step size"'
          Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this problem by specifying an initial stepsize (default is computed automatically).

    `"maximum order"'
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must be between 1 and 5, inclusive (default is 5).

    `"maximum step size"'
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large regions (default is not specified).

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)

     The second and third arguments to `daspk' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  If they are not consistent, you must use the `daspk_options' function to provide additional information so that `daspk' can compute a consistent starting point.

     The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASPK).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function `daspk_options' to set optional parameters for `daspk'.

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     with functional stopping criteria (root solving).

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T_OUT.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The vector T provides an upper limit on the length of the integration.  If the stopping condition is met, the vector T_OUT will be shorter than T, and the final element of T_OUT will be the point at which the stopping condition was met, and may not correspond to any element of the vector T.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)

     The optional second argument names a function that defines the constraint functions whose roots are desired during the integration.  This function must have the form

          G_OUT = g (X, T)

     and return a vector of the constraint function values.  If the value of any of the constraint functions changes sign, DASRT will attempt to stop the integration at the point of the sign change.

     If the name of the constraint function is omitted, `dasrt' solves the same problem as `daspk' or `dassl'.

     Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions due to round-off and integration error, DASRT may return false roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values of T.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of the constraint functions.

     If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the problem, the input to DASRT should nevertheless allow integration to a point slightly past that root, so that DASRT can locate the root by interpolation.

     The third and fourth arguments to `dasrt' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

     The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function `dasrt_options' to set optional parameters for `dasrt'.

    `"compute consistent initial condition"'
          If nonzero, `dassl' will attempt to compute a consistent set of initial conditions.  This is generally not reliable, so it is best to provide a consistent set and leave this option set to zero.

    `"enforce nonnegativity constraints"'
          If you know that the solutions to your equations will always be non-negative, it may help to set this parameter to a nonzero value.  However, it is probably best to try leaving this option set to zero first, and only setting it to a nonzero value if that doesn't work very well.

 -- Loadable Function: [X, XDOT, ISTATE, MSG] = dassl (FCN, X_0, XDOT_0, T, T_CRIT)
     Solve the set of differential-algebraic equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)

     The second and third arguments to `dassl' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

     The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function `dassl_options' to set optional parameters for `dassl'.

 -- Loadable Function: DATA = dlmread (FILE, SEP, RANGE)
 -- Loadable Function: DATA = dlmread (..., "emptyvalue", EMPTYVAL)
     Read the matrix DATA from a text file.  If not defined the separator between fields is determined from the file itself.  Otherwise the separation character is defined by SEP.

     Given two scalar arguments R0 and C0, these define the starting row and column of the data to be read.  These values are indexed from zero, such that the first row corresponds to an index of zero.

     The RANGE parameter may be a 4-element vector containing the upper left and lower right corner `[R0,C0,R1,C1]' where the lowest index value is zero.  Alternatively, a spreadsheet style range such as "A2..Q15" or "T1:AA5" can be used.  The lowest alphabetical index 'A' refers to the first column.  The lowest row index is 1.

     FILE should be a file name or file id given by `fopen'.  In the latter case, the file is read until end of file is reached.

     The "emptyvalue" option may be used to specify the value used to fill empty fields.  The default is zero.

 -- Loadable Function: P = dmperm (S)
 -- Loadable Function: [P, Q, R, S] = dmperm (S)
     Perform a Dulmage-Mendelsohn permutation of the sparse matrix S.  With a single output argument `dmperm' performs the row permutations P such that `S(P,:)' has no zero elements on the diagonal.

     Called with two or more output arguments, returns the row and column permutations, such that `S(P, Q)' is in block triangular form.  The values of R and S define the boundaries of the blocks.  If S is square then `R == S'.

     The method used is described in: A. Pothen & C.-J. Fan. `Computing the Block Triangular Form of a Sparse Matrix'. ACM Trans. Math. Software, 16(4):303-324, 1990.

     Compute the dot product of two vectors.  If X and Y are matrices, calculate the dot products along the first non-singleton dimension.  If the optional argument DIM is given, calculate the dot products along this dimension.

     This is equivalent to `sum (conj (X) .* Y, DIM)', but avoids forming a temporary array and is faster.  When X and Y are column vectors, the result is equivalent to `X' * Y'.

     Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

     Eigenvalues are computed in a several step process which begins with a Hessenberg decomposition, followed by a Schur decomposition, from which the eigenvalues are apparent.  The eigenvectors, when desired, are computed by further manipulations of the Schur decomposition.

     Calculate a limited number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, based on a selection criteria.  The number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to calculate is given by K and defaults to 6.

     By default, `eigs' solve the equation `A * v = lambda * v', where `lambda' is a scalar representing one of the eigenvalues, and `v' is the corresponding eigenvector.  If given the positive definite matrix B then `eigs' solves the general eigenvalue equation `A * v = lambda * B * v'.

     The argument SIGMA determines which eigenvalues are returned.  SIGMA can be either a scalar or a string.  When SIGMA is a scalar, the K eigenvalues closest to SIGMA are returned.  If SIGMA is a string, it must have one of the following values.

    "lm"
          Largest Magnitude (default).

    "sm"
          Smallest Magnitude.

    "la"
          Largest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

    "sa"
          Smallest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

    "be"
          Both Ends, with one more from the high-end if K is odd (valid only for real symmetric problems).

    "lr"
          Largest Real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

    "sr"
          Smallest Real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

    "li"
          Largest Imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

    "si"
          Smallest Imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

     If OPTS is given, it is a structure defining possible options that `eigs' should use.  The fields of the OPTS structure are:

    `issym'
          If AF is given, then flags whether the function AF defines a symmetric problem.  It is ignored if A is given.  The default is false.

    `isreal'
          If AF is given, then flags whether the function AF defines a real problem.  It is ignored if A is given.  The default is true.

    `tol'
          Defines the required convergence tolerance, calculated as `tol * norm (A)'.  The default is `eps'.

    `maxit'
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

    `p'
          The number of Lanzcos basis vectors to use.  More vectors will result in faster convergence, but a greater use of memory.  The optimal value of `p' is problem dependent and should be in the range K to N.  The default value is `2 * K'.

    `v0'
          The starting vector for the algorithm.  An initial vector close to the final vector will speed up convergence.  The default is for ARPACK to randomly generate a starting vector.  If specified, `v0' must be an N-by-1 vector where `N = rows (A)'

    `disp'
          The level of diagnostic printout (0|1|2).  If `disp' is 0 then diagnostics are disabled.  The default value is 0.

    `cholB'
          Flag if `chol (B)' is passed rather than B.  The default is false.

    `permB'
          The permutation vector of the Cholesky factorization of B if `cholB' is true.  That is `chol (B(permB, permB))'.  The default is `1:N'.

     It is also possible to represent A by a function denoted AF.  AF must be followed by a scalar argument N defining the length of the vector argument accepted by AF.  AF can be a function handle, an inline function, or a string.  When AF is a string it holds the name of the function to use.

     AF is a function of the form `y = af (x)' where the required return value of AF is determined by the value of SIGMA.  The four possible forms are

    `A * x'
          if SIGMA is not given or is a string other than "sm".

    `A \ x'
          if SIGMA is 0 or "sm".

    `(A - sigma * I) \ x'
          for the standard eigenvalue problem, where `I' is the identity matrix of the same size as A.

    `(A - sigma * B) \ x'
          for the general eigenvalue problem.

     The return arguments of `eigs' depend on the number of return arguments requested.  With a single return argument, a vector D of length K is returned containing the K eigenvalues that have been found.  With two return arguments, V is a N-by-K matrix whose columns are the K eigenvectors corresponding to the returned eigenvalues.  The eigenvalues themselves are returned in D in the form of a N-by-K matrix, where the elements on the diagonal are the eigenvalues.

     Given a third return argument FLAG, `eigs' returns the status of the convergence.  If FLAG is 0 then all eigenvalues have converged.  Any other value indicates a failure to converge.

     This function is based on the ARPACK package, written by R. Lehoucq, K. Maschhoff, D. Sorensen, and C. Yang.  For more information see `http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/'.

     Compute the discrete Fourier transform of A using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

     The FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension of the array.  Thus if X is a matrix, `fft (X)' computes the FFT for each column of X.

     If called with two arguments, N is expected to be an integer specifying the number of elements of X to use, or an empty matrix to specify that its value should be ignored.  If N is larger than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then X is resized and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if N is smaller than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then X is truncated.

     If called with three arguments, DIM is an integer specifying the dimension of the matrix along which the FFT is performed

 -- Loadable Function:  fftw ("dwisdom", WISDOM)
     Manage FFTW wisdom data.  Wisdom data can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation of the FFTs, but implies an initial cost in its calculation.  When the FFTW libraries are initialized, they read a system wide wisdom file (typically in `/etc/fftw/wisdom'), allowing wisdom to be shared between applications other than Octave.  Alternatively, the `fftw' function can be used to import wisdom.  For example,

          WISDOM = fftw ("dwisdom")

     will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string WISDOM.  This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the `save' and `load' commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can be reimported as follows

          fftw ("dwisdom", WISDOM)

     If WISDOM is an empty matrix, then the wisdom used is cleared.

     During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is generated.  The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is also controlled by the `fftw' function.  There are five different manners in which the wisdom can be treated:

    "estimate"
          Specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The advantage of this method is that there is little or no overhead in the generation of the plan, which is appropriate for a Fourier transform that will be calculated once.

    "measure"
          In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is considered and the best is selected based on their execution time.

    "patient"
          Similar to "measure", but a wider range of algorithms is considered.

    "exhaustive"
          Like "measure", but all possible algorithms that may be used to treat the transform are considered.

    "hybrid"
          As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive, this is a compromise where "measure" is used for transforms up to the size of 8192 and beyond that the "estimate" method is used.

     The default method is "estimate".  The current method can be queried with

          METHOD = fftw ("planner")

     or set by using

          fftw ("planner", METHOD)

     Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.  However, the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file as described above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on different platforms since they will not be efficient and the point of calculating the wisdom is lost.

                    N                   M
          y(n) = - SUM c(k+1) y(n-k) + SUM d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)
                   k=1                 k=0

     where  c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).

     If the fourth argument SI is provided, it is taken as the initial state of the system and the final state is returned as SF.  The state vector is a column vector whose length is equal to the length of the longest coefficient vector minus one.  If SI is not supplied, the initial state vector is set to all zeros.

     In terms of the Z Transform, y is the result of passing the discrete- time signal x through a system characterized by the following rational system function:

                    M
                   SUM d(k+1) z^(-k)

 -- Loadable Function: [i, j, v] = find (...)
     Return a vector of indices of nonzero elements of a matrix, as a row if X is a row vector or as a column otherwise.  To obtain a single index for each matrix element, Octave pretends that the columns of a matrix form one long vector (like Fortran arrays are stored).  For example:

          find (eye (2))
            => [ 1; 4 ]

     If two outputs are requested, `find' returns the row and column indices of nonzero elements of a matrix.  For example:

          [i, j] = find (2 * eye (2))
              => i = [ 1; 2 ]
              => j = [ 1; 2 ]

     If three outputs are requested, `find' also returns a vector containing the nonzero values.  For example:

          [i, j, v] = find (3 * eye (2))
                 => i = [ 1; 2 ]
                 => j = [ 1; 2 ]
                 => v = [ 3; 3 ]

     If two inputs are given, N indicates the maximum number of elements to find from the beginning of the matrix or vector.

     If three inputs are given, DIRECTION should be one of "first" or "last", requesting only the first or last N indices, respectively.  However, the indices are always returned in ascending order.

     Note that this function is particularly useful for sparse matrices, as it extracts the non-zero elements as vectors, which can then be used to create the original matrix.  For example:

          sz = size (a);
          [i, j, v] = find (a);
          b = sparse (i, j, v, sz(1), sz(2));

     with the limiting value of 1 as X approaches infinity.  The standard notation is P(a,x), e.g., Abramowitz and Stegun (6.5.1).

     If A is scalar, then `gammainc (X, A)' is returned for each element of X and vice versa.

     If neither X nor A is scalar, the sizes of X and A must agree, and `gammainc' is applied element-by-element.

     By default the incomplete gamma function integrated from 0 to X is computed.  If "upper" is given then the complementary function integrated from X to infinity is calculated.  It should be noted that

          gammainc (X, A) == 1 - gammainc (X, A, "upper")

     Compute the greatest common divisor of A1, A2, ....  If more than one argument is given all arguments must be the same size or scalar.  In this case the greatest common divisor is calculated for each element individually.  All elements must be ordinary or Gaussian (complex) integers.  Note that for Gaussian integers, the gcd is not unique up to units (multiplication by 1, -1, I or -I), so an arbitrary greatest common divisor amongst four possible is returned.

     Example code:

          gcd ([15, 9], [20, 18])
             =>  5  9

     In general it is best to avoid calculating the inverse of a matrix directly.  For example, it is both faster and more accurate to solve systems of equations (A*x = b) with `Y = A \ b', rather than `Y = inv (A) * b'.

     If called with a sparse matrix, then in general X will be a full matrix requiring significantly more storage.  Avoid forming the inverse of a sparse matrix if possible.

 -- Loadable Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y)
 -- Loadable Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y, OPT)
     Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to interpolation.

     If table is increasing and `idx = lookup (table, y)', then `table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))' for all `y(i)' within the table.  If `y(i) < table(1)' then `idx(i)' is 0. If `y(i) >= table(end)' or `isnan (y(i))' then `idx(i)' is `n'.

     If the table is decreasing, then the tests are reversed.  For non-strictly monotonic tables, empty intervals are always skipped.  The result is undefined if TABLE is not monotonic, or if TABLE contains a NaN.

     The complexity of the lookup is O(M*log(N)) where N is the size of TABLE and M is the size of Y.  In the special case when Y is also sorted, the complexity is O(min(M*log(N),M+N)).

     TABLE and Y can also be cell arrays of strings (or Y can be a single string).  In this case, string lookup is performed using lexicographical comparison.

     If OPTS is specified, it must be a string with letters indicating additional options.

    `m'
          `table(idx(i)) == val(i)' if `val(i)' occurs in table; otherwise, `idx(i)' is zero.

    `b'
          `idx(i)' is a logical 1 or 0, indicating whether `val(i)' is contained in table or not.

    `l'
          For numeric lookups the leftmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at least 1)

    `r'
          For numeric lookups the rightmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at most n-1).

          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector.

    `"relative tolerance"'
          Relative tolerance parameter.  Unlike the absolute tolerance, this parameter may only be a scalar.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
                     rtol * abs (y(i)) + atol(i)

         "adams"
         "non-stiff"
               No Jacobian used (even if it is available).

         "bdf"
         "stiff"
               Use stiff backward differentiation formula (BDF) method.  If a function to compute the Jacobian is not supplied, `lsode' will compute a finite difference approximation of the Jacobian matrix.

          dt

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0

     The solution is returned in the matrix X, with each row corresponding to an element of the vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and should correspond to the initial state of the system X_0, so that the first row of the output is X_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of right hand sides for the set of equations.  The function must have the form

          XDOT = f (X, T)

     in which XDOT and X are vectors and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the Jacobian of f.  The Jacobian function must have the form

          JAC = j (X, T)

     in which JAC is the matrix of partial derivatives

                       | df_1  df_1       df_1 |

     The second and third arguments specify the initial state of the system, x_0, and the initial value of the independent variable t_0.

     The fourth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the ODE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be 2 (consistent with the Fortran version of LSODE).

     If the computation is not successful, ISTATE will be something other than 2 and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function `lsode_options' to set optional parameters for `lsode'.

     Compute the LU decomposition of A.  If A is full subroutines from LAPACK are used and if A is sparse then UMFPACK is used.  The result is returned in a permuted form, according to the optional return value P.  For example, given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [l, u, p] = lu (A)

     returns

          l =

            1.00000  0.00000
            0.33333  1.00000

          u =

            3.00000  4.00000
            0.00000  0.66667

          p =

            0  1
            1  0

     The matrix is not required to be square.

     When called with two or three output arguments and a spare input matrix, `lu' does not attempt to perform sparsity preserving column permutations.  Called with a fourth output argument, the sparsity preserving column transformation Q is returned, such that `P * A * Q = L * U'.

     Called with a fifth output argument and a sparse input matrix, `lu' attempts to use a scaling factor R on the input matrix such that `P * (R \ A) * Q = L * U'.  This typically leads to a sparser and more stable factorization.

     An additional input argument THRES, that defines the pivoting threshold can be given.  THRES can be a scalar, in which case it defines the UMFPACK pivoting tolerance for both symmetric and unsymmetric cases.  If THRES is a 2-element vector, then the first element defines the pivoting tolerance for the unsymmetric UMFPACK pivoting strategy and the second for the symmetric strategy.  By default, the values defined by `spparms' are used ([0.1, 0.001]).

     Given the string argument "vector", `lu' returns the values of P and Q as vector values, such that for full matrix, `A (P,:) = L * U', and `R(P,:) * A (:, Q) = L * U'.

     With two output arguments, returns the permuted forms of the upper and lower triangular matrices, such that `A = L * U'.  With one output argument Y, then the matrix returned by the LAPACK routines is returned.  If the input matrix is sparse then the matrix L is embedded into U to give a return value similar to the full case.  For both full and sparse matrices, `lu' loses the permutation information.

     Given an LU factorization of a real or complex matrix A = L*U, L lower unit trapezoidal and U upper trapezoidal, return the LU factorization of A + X*Y.', where X and Y are column vectors (rank-1 update) or matrices with equal number of columns (rank-k update).  Optionally, row-pivoted updating can be used by supplying a row permutation (pivoting) matrix P; in that case, an updated permutation matrix is returned.  Note that if L, U, P is a pivoted LU factorization as obtained by `lu':

          [L, U, P] = lu (A);

     then a factorization of A+X*Y.' can be obtained either as

          [L1, U1] = lu (L, U, P*X, Y)

     or

          [L1, U1, P1] = lu (L, U, P, X, Y)

     The first form uses the unpivoted algorithm, which is faster, but less stable.  The second form uses a slower pivoted algorithm, which is more stable.

     The matrix case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates; thus, for large enough k, it will be both faster and more accurate to recompute the factorization from scratch.

 -- Loadable Function: [L, U, P, Q] = luinc (A, OPTS)
     Produce the incomplete LU factorization of the sparse matrix A.  Two types of incomplete factorization are possible, and the type is determined by the second argument to `luinc'.

     Called with a second argument of '0', the zero-level incomplete LU factorization is produced.  This creates a factorization of A where the position of the non-zero arguments correspond to the same positions as in the matrix A.

     Alternatively, the fill-in of the incomplete LU factorization can be controlled through the variable DROPTOL or the structure OPTS.  The UMFPACK multifrontal factorization code by Tim A.  Davis is used for the incomplete LU factorization, (availability `http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/')

     DROPTOL determines the values below which the values in the LU  factorization are dropped and replaced by zero.  It must be a positive scalar, and any values in the factorization whose absolute value are less than this value are dropped, expect if leaving them increase the sparsity of the matrix.  Setting DROPTOL to zero results in a complete LU factorization which is the default.

     OPTS is a structure containing one or more of the fields

    `droptol'
          The drop tolerance as above.  If OPTS only contains `droptol' then this is equivalent to using the variable DROPTOL.

    `milu'
          A logical variable flagging whether to use the modified incomplete LU  factorization.  In the case that `milu' is true, the dropped values are subtracted from the diagonal of the matrix U of the factorization.  The default is `false'.

    `udiag'
          A logical variable that flags whether zero elements on the diagonal of U should be replaced with DROPTOL to attempt to avoid singular factors.  The default is `false'.

    `thresh'
          Defines the pivot threshold in the interval [0,1].  Values outside that range are ignored.

     All other fields in OPTS are ignored.  The outputs from `luinc' are the same as for `lu'.

     Given the string argument "vector", `luinc' returns the values of P Q as vector values.

     Identify the matrix type or mark a matrix as a particular type.  This allows more rapid solutions of linear equations involving A to be performed.  Called with a single argument, `matrix_type' returns the type of the matrix and caches it for future use.  Called with more than one argument, `matrix_type' allows the type of the matrix to be defined.

     If the option "nocompute" is given, the function will not attempt to guess the type if it is still unknown.  This is useful for debugging purposes.

     The possible matrix types depend on whether the matrix is full or sparse, and can be one of the following

    "unknown"
          Remove any previously cached matrix type, and mark type as unknown.

    "full"
          Mark the matrix as full.

    "positive definite"
          Probable full positive definite matrix.

    "diagonal"
          Diagonal matrix.  (Sparse matrices only)

    "permuted diagonal"
          Permuted Diagonal matrix.  The permutation does not need to be specifically indicated, as the structure of the matrix explicitly gives this.  (Sparse matrices only)

    "upper"
          Upper triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted upper triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

    "lower"
          Lower triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted lower triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

    "banded"
    "banded positive definite"
          Banded matrix with the band size of NL below the diagonal and NU above it.  If NL and NU are 1, then the matrix is tridiagonal and treated with specialized code.  In addition the matrix can be marked as probably a positive definite.  (Sparse matrices only)

    "singular"
          The matrix is assumed to be singular and will be treated with a minimum norm solution.


     Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the first attempt to solve a linear equation involving A.  Therefore `matrix_type' is only useful to give Octave hints of the matrix type.  Incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in incorrect results from solutions of linear equations; it is entirely *the responsibility of the user* to correctly identify the matrix type.

     Also, the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a Hermitian matrix with a real positive diagonal.  This does not guarantee that the matrix is positive definite, but only that it is a probable candidate.  When such a matrix is factorized, a Cholesky factorization is first attempted, and if that fails the matrix is then treated with an LU factorization.  Once the matrix has been factorized, `matrix_type' will return the correct classification of the matrix.

     for overdetermined systems of equations (i.e., A  is a tall, thin matrix).  The QR factorization is `Q * Q = A' where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is upper triangular.

     If given a second argument of '0', `qr' returns an economy-sized QR factorization, omitting zero rows of R and the corresponding columns of Q.

     If the matrix A is full, the permuted QR factorization `[Q, R, P] = qr (A)' forms the QR factorization such that the diagonal entries of R are decreasing in magnitude order.  For example, given the matrix `a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [Q, R, P] = qr (A)

     returns

          Q =

            -0.44721  -0.89443
            -0.89443   0.44721

          R =

            -4.47214  -3.13050
             0.00000   0.44721

          P =

             0  1
             1  0

     The permuted `qr' factorization `[Q, R, P] = qr (A)' factorization allows the construction of an orthogonal basis of `span (A)'.

     If the matrix A is sparse, then compute the sparse QR factorization of A, using CSPARSE.  As the matrix Q is in general a full matrix, this function returns the Q-less factorization R of A, such that `R = chol (A' * A)'.

     If the final argument is the scalar `0' and the number of rows is larger than the number of columns, then an economy factorization is returned.  That is R will have only `size (A,1)' rows.

     If an additional matrix B is supplied, then `qr' returns C, where `C = Q' * B'.  This allows the least squares approximation of `A \ B' to be calculated as

          [C, R] = qr (A, B)
          x = R \ C

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using Fortran routines from QUADPACK.  F is a function handle, inline function, or a string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function must have the form `y = f (x)' where Y and X are scalars.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or both may be infinite.

     The optional argument TOL is a vector that specifies the desired accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative tolerance to zero.  Both tolerances default to `sqrt(eps)' or approximately 1.5e^-8.

     The optional argument SING is a vector of values at which the integrand is known to be singular.

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.  IER contains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful integration).  NFUN indicates the number of function evaluations that were made, and ERR contains an estimate of the error in the solution.

     The function `quad_options' can set other optional parameters for `quad'.

     Note: because `quad' is written in Fortran it cannot be called recursively.  This prevents its use in integrating over more than one variable by routines `dblquad' and `triplequad'.

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using the doubly-adaptive Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature described by P. Gonnet in `Increasing the Reliability of Adaptive Quadrature Using Explicit Interpolants'.  F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be vectorized and must return a vector of output values if given a vector of input values.  For example,

          f = @(x) x .* sin (1./x) .* sqrt (abs (1 - x));

     which uses the element-by-element `dot' form for all operators.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or both limits may be infinite.  `quadcc' handles an inifinite limit by substituting the variable of integration with `x=tan(pi/2*u)'.

     The optional argument TOL defines the relative tolerance used to stop the integration procedure.  The default value is 1e^-6.

     The optional argument SING contains a list of points where the integrand has known singularities, or discontinuities in any of its derivatives, inside the integration interval.  For the example above, which has a discontinuity at x=1, the call to `quadcc' would be as follows

          int = quadcc (f, a, b, 1.0e-6, [ 1 ]);

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.  ERR is an estimate of the absolute integration error and NR_POINTS is the number of points at which the integrand was evaluated.  If the adaptive integration did not converge, the value of ERR will be larger than the requested tolerance.  Therefore, it is recommended to verify this value for difficult integrands.

     `quadcc' is capable of dealing with non-numeric values of the integrand such as `NaN' or `Inf'.  If the integral diverges, and `quadcc' detects this, then a warning is issued and `Inf' or `-Inf' is returned.

     Note: `quadcc' is a general purpose quadrature algorithm and, as such, may be less efficient for a smooth or otherwise well-behaved integrand than other methods such as `quadgk'.

     The algorithm uses Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules of increasing degree in each interval and bisects the interval if either the function does not appear to be smooth or a rule of maximum degree has been reached.  The error estimate is computed from the L2-norm of the difference between two successive interpolations of the integrand over the nodes of the respective quadrature rules.

 -- Loadable Function: LAMBDA = qz (A, B)
 -- Loadable Function: LAMBDA = qz (A, B, OPT)
     QZ decomposition of the generalized eigenvalue problem (A x = s B x).  There are three ways to call this function:
       1. `LAMBDA = qz (A, B)'

          Computes the generalized eigenvalues LAMBDA of (A - s B).

       2. `[AA, BB, Q, Z, V, W, LAMBDA] = qz (A, B)'

          Computes QZ decomposition, generalized eigenvectors, and generalized eigenvalues of (A - s B)


               A * V = B * V * diag (LAMBDA)
               W' * A = diag (LAMBDA) * W' * B
               AA = Q * A * Z, BB = Q * B * Z

          with Q and Z orthogonal (unitary)= I

       3. `[AA,BB,Z{, LAMBDA}] = qz (A, B, OPT)'

          As in form [2], but allows ordering of generalized eigenpairs for (e.g.) solution of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations.  Form 3 is not available for complex matrices, and does not compute the generalized eigenvectors V, W, nor the orthogonal matrix Q.

         OPT
               for ordering eigenvalues of the GEP pencil.  The leading block of the revised pencil contains all eigenvalues that satisfy:

              "N"
                    = unordered (default)

              "S"
                    = small: leading block has all |lambda| <= 1

              "B"
                    = big: leading block has all |lambda| >= 1

              "-"
                    = negative real part: leading block has all eigenvalues in the open left half-plane

              "+"
                    = non-negative real part: leading block has all eigenvalues in the closed right half-plane

     Note: `qz' performs permutation balancing, but not scaling (*note doc-balance::).  The order of output arguments was selected for compatibility with MATLAB.

     Return a matrix with random elements uniformly distributed on the interval (0, 1).  The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for `eye'.

     You can query the state of the random number generator using the form

          v = rand ("state")

     This returns a column vector V of length 625.  Later, you can restore the random number generator to the state V using the form

          rand ("state", v)

     You may also initialize the state vector from an arbitrary vector of length <= 625 for V.  This new state will be a hash based on the value of V, not V itself.

     By default, the generator is initialized from `/dev/urandom' if it is available, otherwise from CPU time, wall clock time, and the current fraction of a second.  Note that this differs from MATLAB, which always initializes the state to the same state at startup.  To obtain behavior comparable to MATLAB, initialize with a deterministic state vector in Octave's startup files (*note Startup Files::).

     To compute the pseudo-random sequence, `rand' uses the Mersenne Twister with a period of 2^19937-1 (See M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, `Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator', ACM Trans. on Modeling and Computer Simulation Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 3-30, January 1998, `http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html').  Do *not* use for cryptography without securely hashing several returned values together, otherwise the generator state can be learned after reading 624 consecutive values.

     Older versions of Octave used a different random number generator.  The new generator is used by default as it is significantly faster than the old generator, and produces random numbers with a significantly longer cycle time.  However, in some circumstances it might be desirable to obtain the same random sequences as used by the old generators.  To do this the keyword "seed" is used to specify that the old generators should be use, as in

          rand ("seed", val)

     which sets the seed of the generator to VAL.  The seed of the generator can be queried with

          s = rand ("seed")

     However, it should be noted that querying the seed will not cause `rand' to use the old generators, only setting the seed will.  To cause `rand' to once again use the new generators, the keyword "state" should be used to reset the state of the `rand'.

     The state or seed of the generator can be reset to a new random value using the "reset" keyword.

     The class of the value returned can be controlled by a trailing "double" or "single" argument. These are the only valid classes.

     Return a matrix with Poisson distributed random elements with mean value parameter given by the first argument, L.  The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for `rand', except for the argument L.

     Five different algorithms are used depending on the range of L and whether or not L is a scalar or a matrix.

    For scalar L <= 12, use direct method.

    For scalar L > 12, use rejection method.[1]

     Return a row vector containing a random permutation of `1:N'.  If M is supplied, return M unique entries, sampled without replacement from `1:N'.  The complexity is O(N) in memory and O(M) in time, unless M < N/5, in which case O(M) memory is used as well.  The randomization is performed using rand(). All permutations are equally likely.

 -- Loadable Function: C = rcond (A)
     Compute the 1-norm estimate of the reciprocal condition number as returned by LAPACK.  If the matrix is well-conditioned then C will be near 1 and if the matrix is poorly conditioned it will be close to zero.

     The matrix A must not be sparse.  If the matrix is sparse then `condest (A)' or `rcond (full (A))' should be used instead.

 -- Loadable Function: [S, E, TE, M, T, NM, SP] = regexp (STR, PAT)
 -- Loadable Function: [...] = regexp (STR, PAT, "OPT1", ...)
     Regular expression string matching.  Search for PAT in STR and return the positions and substrings of any matches, or empty values if there are none.

     The matched pattern PAT can include any of the standard regex operators, including:

    `.'
          Match any character

    `* + ? {}'
          Repetition operators, representing

         `*'
               Match zero or more times

         `+'
               Match one or more times

         `?'
               Match zero or one times

         `{N}'
               Match exactly N times

         `{N,}'
               Match N or more times

         `{M,N}'
               Match between M and N times

    `[...] [^...]'
          List operators.  The pattern will match any character listed between "[" and "]".  If the first character is "^" then the pattern is inverted and any character except those listed between brackets will match.

          Escape sequences defined below can also be used inside list operators.  For example, a template for a floating point number might be `[-+.\d]+'.

    `() (?:)'
          Grouping operator.  The first form, parentheses only, also creates a token.

    `|'
          Alternation operator.  Match one of a choice of regular expressions.  The alternatives must be delimited by the grouping operator `()' above.

    `^ $'
          Anchoring operators.  Requires pattern to occur at the start (`^') or end (`$') of the string.

     In addition, the following escaped characters have special meaning.  Note, it is recommended to quote PAT in single quotes, rather than double quotes, to avoid the escape sequences being interpreted by Octave before being passed to `regexp'.

    `\b'
          Match a word boundary

    `\B'
          Match within a word

    `\w'
          Match any word character

    `\W'
          Match any non-word character

    `\<'
          Match the beginning of a word

    `\>'
          Match the end of a word

    `\s'
          Match any whitespace character

    `\S'
          Match any non-whitespace character

    `\d'
          Match any digit

    `\D'
          Match any non-digit

     The outputs of `regexp' default to the order given below

    S
          The start indices of each matching substring

    E
          The end indices of each matching substring

    TE
          The extents of each matched token surrounded by `(...)' in PAT

    M
          A cell array of the text of each match

    T
          A cell array of the text of each token matched

    NM
          A structure containing the text of each matched named token, with the name being used as the fieldname.  A named token is denoted by `(?<name>...)'.

    SP
          A cell array of the text not returned by match, i.e., what remains if you split the string based on PAT.

 -- Loadable Function: S = schur (A, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [U, S] = schur (A, ...)
     Compute the Schur decomposition of A

          `S = U' * A * U'

     where U is a unitary matrix (`U'* U' is identity) and S is upper triangular.  The eigenvalues of A (and S) are the diagonal elements of S.  If the matrix A is real, then the real Schur decomposition is computed, in which the matrix U is orthogonal and S is block upper triangular with blocks of size at most `2 x 2' along the diagonal.  The diagonal elements of S (or the eigenvalues of the `2 x 2' blocks, when appropriate) are the eigenvalues of A and S.

     The default for real matrices is a real Schur decomposition.  A complex decomposition may be forced by passing the flag "complex".

     The eigenvalues are optionally ordered along the diagonal according to the value of OPT.  `OPT = "a"' indicates that all eigenvalues with negative real parts should be moved to the leading block of S (used in `are'), `OPT = "d"' indicates that all eigenvalues with magnitude less than one should be moved to the leading block of S (used in `dare'), and `OPT = "u"', the default, indicates that no ordering of eigenvalues should occur.  The leading K columns of U always span the A-invariant subspace corresponding to the K leading eigenvalues of S.

     The Schur decomposition is used to compute eigenvalues of a square matrix, and has applications in the solution of algebraic Riccati equations in control (see `are' and `dare').

 -- Built-in Function:  str2double (S)
     Convert a string to a real or complex number.

     The string must be in one of the following formats where a and b are real numbers and the complex unit is 'i' or 'j':

        * a + bi

        * a + b*i

        * a + i*b

        * bi + a

        * b*i + a

        * i*b + a

     If present, a and/or b are of the form [+-]d[,.]d[[eE][+-]d] where the brackets indicate optional arguments and 'd' indicates zero or more digits.  The special input values `Inf', `NaN', and `NA' are also accepted.

     S may also be a character matrix, in which case the conversion is repeated for each row.  Or S may be a cell array of strings, in which case each element is converted and an array of the same dimensions is returned.

     `str2double' returns NaN for elements of S which cannot be converted.

     `str2double' can replace `str2num', and it avoids the security risk of using `eval' on unknown data.

 -- Loadable Function: P = symrcm (S)
     Return the symmetric reverse Cuthill-McKee permutation of S.  P is a permutation vector such that `S(P, P)' tends to have its diagonal elements closer to the diagonal than S.  This is a good preordering for LU or Cholesky factorization of matrices that come from "long, skinny" problems.  It works for both symmetric and asymmetric S.

     The algorithm represents a heuristic approach to the NP-complete bandwidth minimization problem.  The implementation is based in the descriptions found in

     E. Cuthill, J. McKee. `Reducing the Bandwidth of Sparse Symmetric Matrices'. Proceedings of the 24th ACM National Conference, 157-172 1969, Brandon Press, New Jersey.

 -- Loadable Function:  strftime (FMT, TM_STRUCT)
     Format the time structure TM_STRUCT in a flexible way using the format string FMT that contains `%' substitutions similar to those in `printf'.  Except where noted, substituted fields have a fixed size; numeric fields are padded if necessary.  Padding is with zeros by default; for fields that display a single number, padding can be changed or inhibited by following the `%' with one of the modifiers described below.  Unknown field specifiers are copied as normal characters.  All other characters are copied to the output without change.  For example:

          strftime ("%r (%Z) %A %e %B %Y", localtime (time ()))
                => "01:15:06 AM (CST) Monday 17 February 1997"

     Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower (`tril') or upper (`triu') triangular part of the matrix A, and setting all other elements to zero.  The second argument is optional, and specifies how many diagonals above or below the main diagonal should also be set to zero.

     The default value of K is zero, so that `triu' and `tril' normally include the main diagonal as part of the result.

     If the value of K is negative, additional elements above (for `tril') or below (for `triu') the main diagonal are also selected.

     The absolute value of K must not be greater than the number of sub-diagonals or super-diagonals.

     For example:

          tril (ones (3), -1)
               =>  0  0  0
                   1  0  0

 -- Loadable Function:  typecast (X, CLASS)
     Return a new array Y resulting from interpreting the data of X in memory as data of the numeric class CLASS.  Both the class of X and CLASS must be one of the built-in numeric classes:

          "logical"
          "char"
          "int8"
          "int16"
          "int32"

          "uint8"

          "uint32"
          "uint64"
          "double"
          "single"
          "double complex"
          "single complex"

     the last two are reserved for CLASS; they indicate that a complex-valued result is requested.  Complex arrays are stored in memory as consecutive pairs of real numbers.  The sizes of integer types are given by their bit counts.  Both logical and char are typically one byte wide; however, this is not guaranteed by C++.  If your system is IEEE conformant, single and double should be 4 bytes and 8 bytes wide, respectively.  "logical" is not allowed for CLASS.  If the input is a row vector, the return value is a row vector, otherwise it is a column vector.  If the bit length of X is not divisible by that of CLASS, an error occurs.

     An example of the use of typecast on a little-endian machine is

          X = uint16 ([1, 65535]);
          typecast (X, "uint8")
            => [   0,   1, 255, 255]

 -- Loadable Function: Y = bitpack (X, CLASS)
     Return a new array Y resulting from interpreting an array X as raw bit patterns for data of the numeric class CLASS.  CLASS must be one of the built-in numeric classes:

          "uint32"
          "uint64"
          "double"
          "single"

     The number of elements of X should be divisible by the bit length of CLASS.  If it is not, excess bits are discarded.  Bits come in increasing order of significance, i.e., `x(1)' is bit 0, `x(2)' is bit 1, etc.  The result is a row vector if X is a row vector, otherwise it is a column vector.

     Download a remote file specified by its URL and save it as LOCALFILE.  For example:

          urlwrite ("ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/octave/README",
                    "README.txt");

     The full path of the downloaded file is returned in F.  The variable SUCCESS is 1 if the download was successful, otherwise it is 0 in which case MESSAGE contains an error message.  If no output argument is specified and an error occurs, then the error is signaled through Octave's error handling mechanism.

     This function uses libcurl.  Curl supports, among others, the HTTP, FTP and FILE protocols.  Username and password may be specified in the URL, for example:

          urlwrite ("http://username:password@example.com/file.txt",
                    "file.txt");

     GET and POST requests can be specified by METHOD and PARAM.  The parameter METHOD is either `get' or `post' and PARAM is a cell array of parameter and value pairs.  For example:

          urlwrite ("http://www.google.com/search", "search.html",
                    "get", {"query", "octave"});
